      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; introduces the popular story of how Native American princess Pocahontas rescued colonist John Smith.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, explore the popular story of how Pocahontas, a young Native American, fell in love with John Smith, an English colonist. When Smith was captured, Pocahontas risked her life to save him, and then continued to help his fellow colonists at Jamestown. Thanks to her, the colony not only survived, but thrived. As the video states, it's a powerful story, but how much of it is true?&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Retell the popular version of the Pocahontas story in your own words.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look at the way that Pocahontas appears in the images in this video segment. What else does this tell you about how Pocahontas is portrayed in popular culture?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think this version of the story about Pocahontas has persisted?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The popular version of the Pocahontas story begins with John Smith's writings about his dramatic rescue. Since then, the story has been retold many times in books and films, where it is often portrayed as an interracial love story. But can we really know what happened?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Smith is the only eyewitness to leave a written record of what happened at Werowocomoco. In 1608, when he first wrote about the famous meeting, he described how Chief Powhatan "kindly welcomed me with good words&amp;hellip;assuring me his friendship, and my liberty within four days." In the next few years, he wrote three more books about his Virginia experiences, but he said no more about this incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not until he published The Generall Historie of Virginia in 1624 that he wrote in detail about how Pocahontas risked her life to save him. This was 17 years after it had happened! Some historians have noted that this later version was published after Pocahontas had become famous in English society, and after both Pocahontas and Chief Powhatan, the only other key witnesses to the event, had died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historians also look to other evidence to better understand what may have happened. Some believe that things took place just as Smith described, but that he misunderstood what happened. Based on new understandings of tribal rituals, historians think the "rescue" may have been an adoption ritual. Smith was symbolically killed and reborn as one of Powhatan's sons. Pocahontas's act was simply her playing a part in this ritual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent archaeological excavations have uncovered the site of Werowocomoco. Because English copper was found at the site, some archaeologists believe Smith may have been meeting with the chief to discuss trade. Smith may have wanted to trade scraps of copper for food for the colonists. The chief, on the other hand, may have been more interested in bringing Smith into his tribe in order to rule over him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no one knows for sure whether Pocahontas and Smith had a romantic relationship, historians doubt this is true. Smith respected Pocahontas and Pocahontas seemed fond of him, but nothing indicates that they were romantically involved. And some historians question whether any rescue, actual or staged, happened at all. John Smith was an adventurer, who had written dramatic accounts of his other travels, including rescues by other prominent women. Perhaps only his first account of meeting Powhatan, in which he was treated well and then sent home, was true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may never really know whether or not Pocahontas rescued John Smith from execution and, if she did, what the reasons were behind her actions. The rest of their story is better understood. In 1608, Pocahontas brought food to the English colonists when their settlement fell on hard times. Good relations continued between the groups until the Native Americans stopped bringing food. Tree-ring dating showed this occurred when a severe drought affected the region. The Native Americans may have feared they would not have enough food to feed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The English then started a war with the Virginia tribes to take what they wanted. Chief Powhatan and his people abandoned Werowocomoco in 1609 because of the hostilities. During this time, Smith was badly burned in a gunpowder explosion and returned to England. Pocahontas was told that Smith was dead. The English later captured Pocahontas. While a prisoner, Pocahontas converted to Christianity, married John Rolfe, had a son, and returned with Rolfe to England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In England, Pocahontas learned that Smith was still alive and saw him again for the first time in eight years. She expressed her sadness to Smith that he, as a tribal family member, did nothing to try to contact her or her father or come back to help them. A few months after the meeting, Pocahontas died as she set sail back to the colonies, and was buried in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about a historical version of the Pocahontas story, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/adlit08.ush.begin.pocareveal/"&gt;Pocahontas Revealed&lt;/a&gt; and the student activity &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/adlit08.soc.sapoca/"&gt;The Story of Pocahontas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To access a student activity about the later interactions between Native Americans and white settlers as the settlers continued to push west, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/adlit08.soc.saland/"&gt;Perspectives on the Land&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parts of this reading have been adapted from &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3407_pocahont.html" target="_blank"&gt;"Pocahontas Revealed" &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Teacher's Guide&lt;/a&gt; developed by WGBH Educational Outreach Department.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, examine a historical version of the story of Pocahontas and John Smith.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; tells a historical version of what may have happened when John Smith was captured by the Powhatan people, and then was rescued by Native American princess Pocahontas. Although one of Smith's later accounts of the event introduced the now popular belief that Pocahontas rescued Smith for romantic love, historians also look to his earlier, different account to try to determine what really happened. One version that some historians believe may be closer to the truth is that Pocahontas was playing her appointed role in an adoption ritual. When she "rescued" Smith, she was actually adopting him into the tribe as her brother and Chief Powhatan's son.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;According to this version of the story, what happened when John Smith was captured by the Powhatan people?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why did Pocahontas rescue John Smith according to this interpretation of the events?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does this version of the story compare with one you may have heard before?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive resource adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Online explores eight of the latest technological developments designed to harness the energy of the Sun.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this interactive activity adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Online, learn about eight of the latest solar technologies: thermal trough, mirrored dish, power tower, thin film, concentrated sunlight, solar paint, evacuated-tube collectors, and sun-grown biofuel. In the face of global climate change, scientists and engineers are actively developing new ways to harness the free and renewable energy of the Sun as an alternative to fossil fuels. Look at photos, an illustration, and text to investigate how these technologies can provide environmentally friendly solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Passive and active solar technologies use sunlight to produce useful forms of energy. Passive solar technology uses no mechanical or electrical devices&amp;mdash;no pumps, fans, or electrical controls&amp;mdash;to convert sunlight or distribute energy. For example, passive solar home design can use windows and walls to absorb solar energy and distribute heat. A trombe wall is a type of wall that is made from a material (such as stone, metal, or concrete) that can store a lot of heat and is painted a dark color to absorb as much of the Sun's energy as possible. During the day, sunlight shines on the wall and warms it up. As the air temperature cools during the night, the wall then radiates heat. Passive heating technologies utilize natural heat transfer mechanisms (radiation, conduction, and convection) to redistribute energy gained from sunlight. Passive home design can be modified with fans to make it more active and help circulate heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active solar technologies use equipment to convert solar energy into usable energy. For example, a common type of solar collector called a flat-plate collector uses sunlight to heat air or fluid (usually water or an antifreeze solution) flowing inside a box; pumps or fans usually circulate the air or fluid. Photovoltaics&amp;mdash;special cells made of semiconductor materials that convert sunlight into electricity&amp;mdash;are another example of an active solar technology. Photovoltaics are useful for a wide range of applications, from powering calculators and road signs, to homes and buildings, and even solar power plants. Concentrating solar power (CSP) systems are generally used for utility-scale electricity production. CSP uses reflective surfaces to concentrate sunlight onto receivers (tubes with fluid flowing through them); the hot fluid is then used to produce electricity in the same way as a conventional steam turbine generator. CSP can also be used for lower-tech applications, such as solar cookers in regions with few other resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sun is an environmentally friendly source of energy, but solar technology suffers from one major obstacle: What happens when there is no sunlight available? Nighttime and clouds prevent both passive and active technologies from functioning, and so researchers are working on finding ways to store energy that has been captured during sunlight hours to be used later. One promising technology for solar power plants is a new kind of battery that is made from all liquid materials (two electrode liquids that are separated by an electrolyte liquid). This battery can operate at high electrical currents, is capable of storing large amounts of electricity, and does not degrade as quickly as traditional batteries. Another potential solution involves molten salts. Molten salts can be heated to very high temperatures and can hold this heat for days. Solar power plants use sunlight to heat the salts, which can then heat water to produce steam to turn turbines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about new solar technologies, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/vtl07.la.ws.process.diffuel/"&gt;A Different Kind of Fuel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/oer08.sci.phys.energy.solarpaint/"&gt;Solar Paint Your Roof&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/oer09.sci.ess.watcyc.solarhome/"&gt;Solar Panels for Your Home&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about photovoltaics, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/psu06-e21.sci.paphotovoltaics/"&gt;Photovoltaics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ate10.sci.phys.energy.solarcell/"&gt;Inside a Solar Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about ways to decrease energy consumption by utilizing solar energy, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/psu06-e21.sci.pasun/"&gt;Pennsylvania Energy: Energy from the Sun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about alternative energy sources, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.beyondfossil/"&gt;Global Warming: Beyond Fossil Fuels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/psu06-e21.sci.energysystem/"&gt;Center for Sustainability at Penn State University: Energy System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This interactive activity adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Online features animations that illustrate the components of a typical photovoltaic cell and how it converts solar energy into electricity.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this interactive activity adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Online, learn how a typical photovoltaic cell converts solar energy into electricity. Explore the components of a photovoltaic cell, including the silicon layers, metal backing, antireflective coating, and metal conductor strips. Using animations, investigate why the silicon layers are doped with phosphorous and boron, and how an electric field is used to generate electricity from sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Many solar technologies have been, and continue to be, developed to harness energy from the Sun, an essentially unlimited source of free and environmentally friendly energy. One such technology&amp;mdash;photovoltaic (PV) cells&amp;mdash;converts sunlight into electricity without producing the harmful emissions that are a by-product of burning fossil fuels in traditional power plants. Typical PV cells are composed of several layers: two different layers of silicon, a metal backing, an antireflective coating, and metal conductor strips. As solar radiation hits the silicon, the energy knocks electrons loose from the silicon atoms; the free electrons then flow out of the cell along the metal conductor strips as electrical current.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PV cells are usually packaged in modules or panels, which are then connected to one another in arrays. PV cells have a variety of applications, from personal electronic devices (such as calculators, cell phone chargers, and bicycle lights) to utility-scale electricity generation at a power plant. Spacecraft and satellites also utilize PV cells to supply energy while in space. Other common uses on the ground include powering road signs, emergency telephones, streetlamps, and driveway lights. PV panels can also be installed to produce environmentally friendly electricity for homes and buildings. Homeowners who install PV systems in homes that are grid connected can sell their excess power to the grid. In addition, PV systems can provide electricity to rural areas that do not have access to the electrical grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The materials and manufacturing techniques used to make PV systems are expensive. High production costs, then, have kept the technology from becoming widely implemented. Despite incentives such as subsidies and tax credits, homeowners still have to pay significant initial costs. However, even though there may be higher initial costs to purchase and install a PV system, the system may pay for itself through fuel savings over the lifetime of its use. Furthermore, alternative materials and new technologies are being developed with the aim to reduce costs. For example, thin-film solar cells use less materials than traditional solar cells. These solar cells consist of a thin layer of semiconductor material applied to a supporting material such as glass, plastic, or metal. The reduction in materials needed to make these cells results in a reduction of cost. Researchers are also working on developing nanoparticles that can convert sunlight to electricity. This technology could possibly be used in something like a "solar paint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limiting factor for PV systems is efficiency. Conventional PV cells convert into electricity only about 15 percent of the light that strikes them. At low efficiencies, larger arrays are needed to generate an adequate amount of electricity, and that means higher cost. Advances in PV technology aim to improve efficiency while also keeping production costs low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about photovoltaics, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/psu06-e21.sci.paphotovoltaics/"&gt;Photovoltaics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about new solar technologies, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ate10.sci.phys.energy.newsolar/"&gt;New Ways to Catch Rays&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/oer08.sci.phys.energy.solarpaint/"&gt;Solar Paint Your Roof&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/vtl07.la.ws.process.diffuel/"&gt;A Different Kind of Fuel &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about ways to decrease energy consumption by utilizing solar energy, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/psu06-e21.sci.pasun/"&gt;Pennsylvania Energy: Energy from the Sun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about alternative energy sources, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.beyondfossil/"&gt;Global Warming: Beyond Fossil Fuels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/psu06-e21.sci.energysystem/"&gt;Center for Sustainability at Penn State University: Energy System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

What happens when the two layers of silicon&amp;mdash;the phosphorous-doped layer and the boron-doped layer&amp;mdash;are joined?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do photons of sunlight cause a photovoltaic cell to generate electricity? What do you think happens to the photon energy that is not converted to electrical current?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What type of current is generated in a PV cell: alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC)? Why do you think an inverter is necessary if the solar cell will be used to power a house?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Learn how biotechnology is used to analyze the evolution of a formerly harmless bacterium into a highly drug-resistant and lethal pathogen in this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn how one species of bacteria, which is harmless to most people, has evolved to become deadly to others. The bacterium, known as &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/em&gt; in medical science, and as "Iraqibacter" to soldiers both in and returning from Iraq, has developed resistance to even the strongest of antibiotics. Iraqibacter's genome reveals that much of its resistance has been acquired from other bacteria species through a process known as horizontal gene transfer. The video also examines how scientists may be able to prevent the bacteria from infecting humans.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Before the Iraq war, pathogenic bacteria known to the medical community as &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/em&gt; attracted little attention. After all, &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacters&lt;/em&gt; are a common soil microbe found in the United States and in other parts of the world. &lt;em&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/em&gt; is ordinarily a commensal bacterium, one that may live on the skin of healthy people for many years without ever causing disease. So, most people exposed to &lt;em&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/em&gt; do not become sick or colonized by them. But hundreds of cases have been reported in recent years, among them large numbers of wounded soldiers in field hospitals in Iraq. The patients who died were shown to have a strain of bacteria, resistant to most drugs, that can survive even on dry, nonliving surfaces for up to two months, making it difficult to control and prevent infections from spreading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/em&gt; is what is known as an opportunistic pathogen. It only infects hosts with compromised immune systems. These include patients taking immunosuppressive therapies, those with immune disorders, and people who have endured enormous stress, as from battle wounds. If it spreads unchecked, &lt;em&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/em&gt; can cause death through high fevers, pneumonia, meningitis, or infections of the spine or blood (sepsis). As many as three out of four infected people have died from it, so it's highly virulent. Even for survivors, the effects of infection can be extreme, including the loss of limbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While most bacteria will die in the presence of an antibiotic, especially if the patient has never taken that particular antibiotic before, some bacteria have mutations that allow them to survive even in the presence of an antibiotic. When antibiotic-resistant bacteria reproduce, the identical copies they make of themselves are also resistant. As bacteria can reproduce exponentially&amp;mdash;going from one to a billion overnight&amp;mdash;the proportion of resistant bacteria is greatly increased. Once established, resistance is hard to eliminate. It may even spread to different species of bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A genomic analysis revealed that &lt;em&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/em&gt; has about 50 resistance genes. In a laboratory setting, it has developed resistance to new drugs in as few as 12 hours. Spontaneous mutations in genomic DNA allow organisms to acquire new characteristics. However, these DNA changes usually occur in increments and typically involve the loss, rather than gain, of a function. Microbes can also change more rapidly under environmental stress by acquiring DNA through a process known as horizontal gene transfer, or HGT. HGT refers to mating processes through which an organism incorporates genetic material from another organism, allowing for gene exchange. The antibiotic-resistant strains of &lt;em&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/em&gt; resulted from nonresistant strains that over time acquired genes via HGT for greater resistance and more virulence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how bacteria develop antibiotic resistance through mutation, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.microbeclock/"&gt;Microbe Clock&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn how antibiotics were first discovered and produced, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/odys08.sci.life.gen.discovery/"&gt;The Discovery of Penicillin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/odys08.sci.life.gen.producing/"&gt;Producing Penicillin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn how a recent discovery that certain bacteria communicate with one another may lead to drug treatments to combat bacterial diseases, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/oer08.sci.life.gen.bassler/"&gt;Talking Bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, take a behind-the-scenes look at the process of personal DNA testing, and hear more about the innovative Personal Genome Project.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; examines the realm of personal DNA testing. It describes the latest tests, which look for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These single-letter differences in DNA sequence make humans unique from one another but may also predispose people to certain diseases. The video also discusses the Personal Genome Project, an extension of the Human Genome Project aimed at determining the root causes of many common diseases. The Personal Genome Project takes into account personal genomics as well as lifestyle information, such as one's living environment, habits, and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Personalized medicine is a buzzword in the field of biotechnology. Essentially, it's the promise of using a patient's unique genetic and epigenetic characteristics to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease. These characteristics may be found in single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs. SNPs are the single-letter variations in nucleotide sequences that exist among humans that make us unique, but that can also affect how we develop diseases. Detailed family histories, patient lifestyle data, gene expression levels, as well as other biological markers are also telling factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spearheaded by Harvard geneticist George Church, the Personal Genome Project, or PGP, is a nonprofit initiative whose stated goal is to make publicly available both the entire DNA sequences and comprehensive health records of 100,000 individuals. To a large degree, the Personal Genome Project picks up where the Human Genome Project left off. It's the next step to using genetic data to identify the causes of disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church's work is founded on openness and automation. Project participants will volunteer their information, and the PGP will automate the sequencing process. Scientists would then be able to search through the resulting database. They could choose a physical trait or condition and a possible genetic correlation, and compare these with the genetic information and analysis obtained from project participants. For example, a certain form of heart disease might be associated with a particular gene and exposure to a particular virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early results from the PGP demonstrate its potential. One of the initial participants learned that he was at heightened risk for several diseases that had not (yet) affected him, including a paralyzing neurological disease and tuberculosis. These kinds of disclosures could change someone's behavior for a lifetime; influencing the amount of attention he or she pays to diet and whether he or she attends regularly scheduled medical checkups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the PGP relies on individuals providing detailed personal information that would be published and freely available to anyone, privacy issues are relevant. Thus, providing protection for the people who choose to have their DNA tested and share information like this is almost necessary for the project to succeed. In 2008, President George W. Bush signed into law the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, or GINA, which was written to prohibit discrimination in health coverage by insurers, and employment (hiring or firing) by businesses on the basis of genetic information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But ethicists are also concerned about the private ventures that have launched since 2007, promising consumers a picture of their genetic risk for disease for a fee. While the companies claim to have the technology to perform genome-wide analysis, some wonder whether businesses will put their marketing pitch ahead of the science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the human genome and the extensive efforts to map it, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.journeydna/"&gt;Journey into DNA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.hgp/"&gt;Human Genome Project&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about how environmental factors and lifestyle choices may influence genes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/biot09.sci.life.gen.epigenetics/"&gt;Epigenetics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the tools used to store DNA sequences, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/biot09.sci.life.gen.dnalibraries/"&gt;DNA Libraries&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn about a radical biotechnology experiment aimed at figuring out how to stop the avian flu virus.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; examines the threat of a virus being spread from birds to humans, and then from humans to humans. It details the mechanisms viruses use to infect cells, and explores how mutations in a virus may change its virulence and how it can spread. It also looks at work being done with a re-created flu virus&amp;mdash;from the deadly 1918 strain&amp;mdash;that may help prevent future flu pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; Normally, it's not easy for humans to get infected with an animal virus. However, in recent years, deadly outbreaks of avian (bird) and swine flu in humans have been reported worldwide. To contract an animal-borne flu, a person must come in direct contact with an infected animal or its excrement. Infection cannot happen through consuming its meat. And if a person becomes sick, it's very difficult for that person to infect another person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because influenza viruses are subject to rapid genetic change, or mutation, especially in mammals, there is reason to believe infection may spread in unprecedented ways. For example, experts are indeed worried that if someone gets a human flu virus and an animal flu virus at the same time, the two viruses may share genetic information and create a new strain capable of infecting either of the species. This could in turn cause a global epidemic, or pandemic, that could kill millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The influenza pandemic of 1918, also known as the Spanish flu, was the deadliest flu pandemic in recent history. Approximately 40 million people died worldwide. It was spread through a strain of influenza A virus called H1N1&amp;mdash;the same strain detected in the 2009 outbreak of swine flu. Dr. Terrence Tumpey, who is featured in this video segment, became interested in understanding the genetic mechanism responsible for such deadly virus strains, especially those that move across species. To answer the questions of whether people infected with an animal flu could infect other humans, and just why these virus strains can be so deadly, Dr. Tumpey decided to recreate the 1918 H1N1 flu virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using genome sequences that were recovered from a 1918 flu victim who was buried in Alaskan permafrost, Tumpey engineered a live virus with the full genetic sequence of the H1N1 flu. Dr. Tumpey's rationale for re-creating the virus was that he had no living virus or infected tissue to study. The only way to really understand the virus, the genes responsible for its extreme virulence, and how scientists might develop antivirals to guard against a future pandemic, was to experiment with the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many other scientists have argued that there is no compelling reason to conduct these experiments, especially with the risks involved. These include the unintended release of the reborn virus into the public if the scientists were unintentionally exposed to it or through an act of bioterrorism. Nevertheless, the U.S. National Institutes of Health supports the research. Preliminary results suggest that just two small changes in the 1918 virus stopped it from spreading between mammals in the laboratory. Insights like this may help scientists prevent a future flu pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn what happens inside a cell when a virus attacks, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.stru.immune/"&gt;Immune Cells in Action&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/den08.sci.life.stru.dengue/"&gt;Dengue Virus Invades a Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is the avian flu virus transmitted?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain the role of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What reasons does Dr. Tumpey give for experimenting with the 1918 and avian flu viruses?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is Dr. Tumpey's radical approach to "virus engineering" controversial? What are the potential benefits of this approach?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn about one scientist's idea for using biotechnology to make ethanol a more efficient alternative to gasoline.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; examines ethanol, a cleaner-burning fuel alternative to gasoline, and the efforts to produce it more efficiently. Today, most ethanol in the United States is made from corn kernels. But converting corn into ethanol requires lots of energy as well as corn, which might otherwise be used to feed people and livestock. The video features research efforts to use less valuable plant matter, called cellulosic biomass, and microorganisms that may be able to accomplish the conversion from plant matter to fuel in a single step. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; There are nearly eight cars for every 10 people in the United States today. The high demand for gasoline requires more than 9 million barrels of oil per day. Not only does this consumption increase the country's dependence on foreign oil, but it also stresses the environment. One alternative to gasoline is ethanol, a fuel made from the fermentation and distillation of sugars and starches. While ethanol has been made from sugarcane, in the U.S. it's usually made from corn, which is a more abundant crop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ethanol is oxygen-rich, so it burns relatively cleanly. By adding it to gasoline, it reduces the amount of gasoline consumed. This in turn reduces the amount of harmful gases that enter the atmosphere and can cause air and water pollution, global warming, and smog. Yet despite these stated environmental benefits, ethanol made from corn kernels has become a controversial subject. Critics believe that widespread production of ethanol will result in more land being used to grow corn for fuel rather than for food. They also believe that producing and using ethanol actually does more harm to the environment than good. According to some calculations, producing corn and processing it into one gallon (3.7 liters) of ethanol requires more energy than that gallon of ethanol contains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A newer and possibly less controversial approach to biofuels is to use cellulosic ethanol, which is made from cellulosic biomass. The term cellulosic biomass refers to nonfood, plant-based material, such as corn stalks, wood chips, and switch grass. While making fuel from cellulosic biomass has the potential to be more sustainable than corn kernel ethanol, it's currently more expensive to produce. Turning biomass into ethanol is a two-step process. First, enzymes must be employed to break the more complex cellulose into simple sugars. Then, yeast must be added to ferment the sugar into ethanol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Genetically modified bacteria, like those discussed in this video segment, could enhance the efficiency and reduce the cost of cellulosic ethanol production by simplifying the two-step process into one. The bacteria are capable of both breaking down the biomass and fermenting the sugar. Further, because the microbes are thermophilic (heat-loving) and grow at temperatures of 50&amp;deg;C to 60&amp;deg;C, they could produce ethanol at higher temperatures than yeast: this reduces the quantity of costly enzymes needed to split the cellulose into sugars that the microbes can ferment. Still, even with this emerging technology, ethanol will probably never replace gasoline in the volume that Americans consume at present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn about other biotechnology-based techniques being used to make more effective biofuels, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/biot09.biotech.app.synthfuel/"&gt;Engineering Biofuels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn about other potential ways to fuel automobiles, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.hydrogencar/"&gt;Global Warming: The Hydrogen Car&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/eng06.sci.engin.systems.fuelcells/"&gt;Fuel Cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn about other ways in which plant matter is converted to energy, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/psu06-e21.sci.pabiomass/"&gt;Pennsylvania Energy: Biomass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the effects of fossil fuel combustion on climate, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.eco.graphairgas/"&gt;1900 Air Pollution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>What is the secret to a long life? Hear from scientists using biotechnology to analyze relationships between specific genes and longevity in this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; examines the link between genes and diet and why certain people live longer than others. While mutations in specific genes seem to provide some groups of people with built-in protection against age-related disorders such as diabetes and heart disease, the amount of food one eats may also promote longevity by triggering a family of genes called sirtuins into action. Researchers are looking to develop drugs that will ward off disease and thereby promote longer life.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;All cells have mechanisms by which certain genes are turned on or off when they are subjected to environmental stresses such as extreme cold, radiation, or viral attack. The genes respond to the stresses by producing proteins. But those mechanisms are prone to break down, especially as the body ages, often leading to serious disease. For nearly 70 years, scientists have known that one kind of stress, calorie restriction, actually prolongs life. In everything from single-celled yeast to worms, mice, and monkeys, persistent hunger has been shown to extend lifespan by as much as one-third. Scientists are currently studying what drives longevity on the molecular level and developing drugs designed to slow the aging process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longevity research is being conducted in many different areas. However, a common focus emerging in recent years is a family of genes called sirtuins. These genes may be responsible for the life-extending effects that have been associated with calorie restriction. Sirtuins have been highly conserved in evolution, meaning that they are found in very simple organisms such as yeasts and worms as well as mammals. In yeast cells, a protein called Sir2 attaches to repeating DNA sequences, which stabilizes the DNA. In addition, Sir2 can also repair damaged DNA. With younger cells, damage is typically limited. But as cells age, damage accumulates. The repair process cannot keep up, and the cell ultimately stops reproducing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Sir2 counterparts in more complex organisms have also been linked to stress response. Seven sirtuin genes have been identified in mammals. The genes reside in different parts of a cell and in different parts of the body. While evidence links their presence (or absence) to aging, the mechanisms that control their activities are not entirely understood. According to one study, sirtuins guard against cell death. When cells experience certain kinds of stress, such as calorie restriction, sirtuins stimulate protein and enzyme production, which in turn activates mitochondria to generate more energy. This slows down the cell's aging process significantly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study is looking at resveratrol, a beneficial chemical found in red wine. High levels of resveratrol in the body are associated with high levels of protective sirtuins, suggesting that resveratrol stimulates sirtuin production. When cell protection fails, proteins misfold and fail to function. As inactive proteins accumulate, the system falls apart. Therefore boosting sirtuin levels in the body using resveratrol or some other chemical may help prevent&amp;mdash;or at least slow the progression of&amp;mdash;certain diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases that involve misfolded proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sirtuins, scientists may have uncovered a universal mechanism for aging. As scientific understanding improves, drugs may one day be developed whereby small molecules manipulate sirtuins to control age-related diseases, including various cancers, adult-onset diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Sirtuins research in its many variations demonstrates how advanced biomedical research and techniques may help resolve fundamental biological questions in ways that were hard to imagine, let alone achieve, just a few years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn how external/environmental factors may also influence gene expression in humans, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/biot09.sci.life.gen.epigenetics/"&gt;Epigenetics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the so-called "powerhouses" of the cell, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.cell.mitostruc/"&gt;Mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is the group of elderly Jews featured at the beginning of the video genetically predisposed to live longer?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain the role of sirtuin genes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how scientists have been able to prolong the life span of the roundworm &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you think are some of the social and ethical implications of discovering the fountain of youth&amp;mdash;in this case, drugs that will either promote longevity or delay aging?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn how what you eat, drink, or smoke may affect the instructions your epigenomes send to your genes, and as a result, change how your DNA is expressed.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn about the epigenome, a set of chemical switches that interact with DNA and affect how some genes are expressed. The epigenome tells cells what they will be and how they will function. Researchers in the field of epigenetics are studying mice as well as humans to determine how gene expression is affected by environmental factors and lifestyle choices. What they've learned is helping them explain differences that can appear over time in identical twins, and more broadly, in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; Nearly every cell in a person's body contains DNA with an identical sequence of nucleotide bases. These double-stranded molecules carry the genetic instructions that encode proteins and enable cells to reproduce and perform specific functions. But the individual members of the genome&amp;mdash;the sum total of DNA contained in an organism&amp;mdash;aren't self-directed. Like actors in a troupe, they need to be assigned roles before the script can be acted out. The epigenome is a set of chemical switches that control gene expression within a cell. It's like a second layer of information that tells genes how to act. By turning some genes on and leaving some genes off, it directs certain cells to become brain cells, others hair cells, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epigenetics is an emerging scientific field. Research focuses on the chemical changes that affect gene expression but do not alter the base sequence of DNA. These chemical changes include methylation, the addition of a methyl group to certain nitrogen bases. Researchers are studying these patterns of gene expression, which are passed on from parent to offspring. They are also studying how environmental factors can change the way in which genes are expressed. A growing body of evidence suggests that a wide variety of illnesses and behaviors may be linked to epigenetic mechanisms. These include various cancers, cognitive dysfunction, and autoimmune diseases. The environmental factors suspected of altering epigenetic processes include heavy metals, pesticides, tobacco smoke, and radioactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video segment demonstrates how epigenetic research is contributing to our understanding of diseases like cancer. Changes in epigenetic programming can cause genes to be turned on all the time, rather than being switched on and off based on the body's needs. This may lead to over-expression and the uncontrolled cell division typical of cancers. In some cases, the problem is precisely the opposite: tumor-suppressing genes, which normally restrict cell division, are switched off. The goal of epigenetic cancer therapy is not to kill cells but rather to change the instructions they are given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic research may also help realize the potential of stem cells for medical applications. One of the primary challenges scientists face is not being able to control how stem cells differentiate into a specific tissue or cell type. They recognize that turning genes on and off plays a key role in differentiation, but they are still searching for the mechanism that controls the switch. Because a stem cell can develop into any tissue or cell type, this suggests that its DNA may be open to epigenetic modification. If scientists could understand which regions of a stem cell's genome are switched on and off and control how this happens, they may be able to reliably deliver stem cells to patients with specific cell or tissue transplant needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn how environmental stress may trigger life-extending genes into action, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/biot09.sci.engin.systems.longevity/"&gt;Longevity Genes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the ways in which stem cells can be used to treat and help cure diseases in humans, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/biot09.sci.life.gen.stemcells/"&gt;Therapeutic Uses of Stem Cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;In what way do the brown and yellow mice shown in the video differ? Why is this so?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain DNA methylation. How does this process influence cellular function?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how two genetically identical twins are not really identical.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain why DNA from an older twin set differs more significantly than the DNA of a younger twin set. What factors could account for this?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; is a dramatized story of chemist Percy Julian&amp;rsquo;s work to synthesize cortisone. Find out how a biological process, not a chemical one, proved the key to producing cortisone in bulk.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn how chemist Percy Julian made cortisone&amp;mdash;a steroid used to treat rheumatoid arthritis&amp;mdash;more easily accessible to millions of patients. Julian knew from earlier studies that plants and animals produced steroids with the same carbon-ring structure, so he isolated large quantities of molecules that closely resembled human cortisone from a cheap and abundant plant source&amp;mdash;soybeans. To produce cortisone from these molecules, scientists had only to find a way to deliver single oxygen atoms to a specific position on their carbon rings. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; Cortisone is a naturally occurring hormone made by the human body's adrenal glands, located just above the kidneys. It is also present in the bile of cattle. In 1948, recognizing cortisone's remarkable effectiveness in shutting down pain receptors, doctors began using cortisone produced from animal bile to treat patients suffering from a debilitating condition called rheumatoid arthritis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although some cortisone circulates naturally through the body, large doses of it are needed to treat the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Because millions of people suffered from the condition&amp;mdash;and because animal bile yielded precious little cortisone at a very high cost&amp;mdash;cortisone was in high demand but short supply. The challenge for scientists was to somehow make a far greater quantity of it at a much lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The process of making a natural substance in the lab from simple building blocks is called synthesis. In order to synthesize a hormone like cortisone, chemists have to first understand how the natural molecule is put together. Based on its chemical structure, cortisone is classified as a steroid hormone. Although different steroids produce different physiological effects, all steroid molecules have a similar chemical structure: a nucleus composed of three six-sided carbon rings fused to each other, and one five-sided ring. In 1948, the procedure used to synthesize cortisone using animal bile involved 38 steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1949, the African American chemist Percy Julian pioneered a much simpler approach, one that used a cheap and abundant source&amp;mdash;soybeans&amp;mdash;in place of animal bile. Working from knowledge established during the 1920s and 1930s, when chemists had discovered that certain plant compounds contained a structural and functional similarity to animal compounds, Julian set out to create a plant-derived compound that would produce the same physiological response in humans as animal-derived cortisone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Julian succeeded in synthesizing a molecule that, though it wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly cortisone, was very similar in its chemical framework. It varied from cortisone by one single oxygen atom. Julian's molecule, known as "Compound S," was also present in the human body. In fact, the body used it to produce natural cortisone in one simple step. Likewise, to make synthetic cortisone from Compound S, one had only to deliver the missing oxygen atom to a precise location on the molecule. Scientists found a way to do this within two years, and cortisone that had previously cost hundreds of dollars a gram could be made for pennies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the different sources of natural compounds used in treating human illnesses, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/drey07.sci.phys.matter.naturepharmacy/"&gt;Nature's Pharmacy &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the molecular structure of steroids, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.buildasteroid/"&gt;Build a Steroid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigate physical and chemical changes in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3402_julian.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn about chemicals in nature that are used in medicine.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, explore images and descriptions of several plants, animals, and microorganisms whose chemical compounds are used in human medicine to treat disease and other conditions (including arthritis and malaria). Medicinal effects of natural substances have long been known to ancient cultures in China, the Americas, and elsewhere. However, modern scientific investigation to identify the chemical compounds that produce these effects is still relatively recent. As their understanding has grown, scientists have been able to create synthetic versions of natural compounds in the lab, yielding powerful drug compounds such as penicillin and cancer-fighting paclitaxel. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; In recent years, newspapers have run countless stories of athletes using steroids to enhance their performance on the track or field and to speed recovery from injury. But steroids are not illicit concoctions prepared on the sly in hidden laboratories. Rather, they are natural compounds, manufactured largely by biochemical companies to treat &lt;em&gt;bona fide&lt;/em&gt; medical conditions including arthritis and sex hormone deficiency. You might be surprised to learn that the bases for steroids and many other natural compounds used to help treat human illnesses originate in plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the early 20th century, chemists began to find structural similarity among a large group of natural substances found in humans and other mammals, including cholesterol, bile acids, and sex hormones. Although the medicinal potential of these compounds quickly became obvious, extracting sufficient quantities of these substances from animal tissue and fluids was very expensive. So the burden fell on chemists to create synthetic substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investigations revealed that certain plant compounds contain a structural and functional similarity to human compounds that produce a sought-after physiological response&amp;mdash;such as shutting down pain receptors. Once these chemical compounds could be isolated from the plant and their molecular structures analyzed, chemists could replicate them in the lab. Plant sources held tremendous promise for medicine because active compounds could be extracted from plants in far greater quantities at a far lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While plants and animals share few physical similarities, they are very similar at the cellular level. All living things produce chemical compounds as part of their normal metabolic activities. Using a similar pathway from species to species, primary metabolism&amp;mdash;also called basic metabolism&amp;mdash;produces all products that are essential for cell growth and development. Examples of primary metabolites are sugars and fats. Secondary metabolism produces molecules that are not important for the survival of the cell, but are important for the survival of the entire organism. In plants, secondary metabolites include flower colors and scents that attract pollinators, as well as toxic components that ward off predators. It is these secondary metabolites that can produce therapeutic effects in humans and that can be refined to produce drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today, it's widely known that the natural world is full of examples of chemical compounds and enzymes vital in the manufacture of medicines. Biomining is the process of seeking organisms for the purpose of exploiting their natural products for drug development and other uses. The focus is on identifying new secondary metabolites in plants, bacteria, fungi, and many marine organisms. The possibility that previously undiscovered plants could have these vital compounds&amp;mdash;for example, plants that grow in dense, unexplored regions of rainforest and undersea&amp;mdash;is a driving argument for preserving biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the steps a chemist uses to tailor organic molecules, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.buildasteroid/"&gt;Build a Steroid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the molecular structure of organic molecules, including alkaloids and steroids, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.carbon/"&gt;Ringed-Carbon Compounds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn about chemist Percy Julian and his pioneering work synthesizing organic compounds to create important therapeutics, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.alkaloid/"&gt;Synthesizing an Alkaloid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.steroids/"&gt;Synthesizing a Steroid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have you ever seen a foxglove plant? Do you think it is likely that other medicinal substances from plants will be discovered? What factors make it more or less likely that this will happen? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you think a scientist goes about finding a plant substance that could be used as a treatment for a specific human condition such as arthritis or cancer? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you think the connections are between the basic metabolisms of plants and humans? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are all bacteria harmful to humans? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this interactive activity adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, expand your understanding of the scientific process. Watch two videos featuring animations and interviews with scientists, and notice how the processes unfold and vary from one investigation to the other.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This interactive activity adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; provides students a way to gain a more accurate understanding of how science is done. Two videos, which feature the work of renowned scientists Percy Julian and Judah Folkman, demonstrate that while scientists may use an orderly approach to learn new information and solve problems, they proceed along different paths in their quests. Instead of referring to a delineated set of steps, the term "scientific process" encompasses the true nature of scientific inquiry. Procedures are often refined as data are collected, and initial hypotheses can be modified or replaced in light of new evidence. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; No matter what their expertise, all scientists seek to develop a deeper understanding of the world we live in. In order to explain observed phenomena or aspects of the distant past in biology, geology, or some other field of inquiry, scientists follow an orderly approach called scientific process. Although often described as a step-by-step set of procedures (as in "the scientific process" or "the scientific method"), scientific process isn't linear. While a set number of elements may be common to all scientific investigations, scientists do not follow a set sequence to complete them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pathway erroneously prescribed for years in textbooks goes something like this: define the problem, gather information, form a hypothesis, make observations, test the hypothesis, draw conclusions, and report results. In reality, scientists approach and solve problems in unique ways. They use a mix of imagination, creativity, and perseverance. While scientists' work may include each of the identified elements, the nature of the research subject and depth of prior knowledge about it will undoubtedly influence the order in which they proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Percy Julian video demonstrates that scientific findings, even published ones, are not indisputable. Even though Percy Julian thought Robert Robinson had been first to synthesize the natural alkaloid physostigmine, upon reviewing his rival's work, he discovered it contained an important error. Knowing that melting point is a characteristic property of a substance, and recognizing that the melting point Robinson reported for his compound did not match physostigmine's, Julian was certain that Robinson had not synthesized physostigmine. He then ran a test that verified that his own compound's melting point was a match. When Julian published his findings, he won credit for having been the first person to synthesize this important drug compound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Judah Folkman video demonstrates that observations can raise new questions and provoke original ideas that need to be investigated. Drawing on his prior experience handling tumors, Dr. Folkman proposed a radical hypothesis to explain tumor growth. He suggested that new blood vessels that formed in surrounding tissue fed tumors. When Folkman reported that he had observed new blood vessel growth, a process called angiogenesis, his scientific peers asked that he explain the mechanism underlying the process. Dr. Folkman's research team sought to identify the chemical responsible for blood-vessel growth. Their investigations into what caused angiogenesis ultimately led them to isolate a molecule&amp;mdash;heparin&amp;mdash;that could prevent angiogenesis, thereby starving tumors of blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about how Percy Julian achieved total synthesis of physostigmine, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.alkaloid/"&gt;Synthesizing an Alkaloid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about Judah Folkman's approach to proving the mechanism behind angiogenesis, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/hew06.sci.life.stru.angiogenesis/"&gt;Blood Vessels Help Tumors Grow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn how Percy Julian used equal parts observation, insight, and determination to synthesize the steroid progesterone, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.steroids/"&gt;Synthesizing a Steroid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn about how scientific processes led to four possible explanations for dinosaur extinction, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.ess.earthsys.dinokill/"&gt;What Killed the Dinosaurs?&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;How would you describe the way Julian went about synthesizing physostigmine? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain Julian's reasoning when he suspected the compound his rival had isolated was very likely not physostigmine. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are some significant ways in which Julian's and Folkman's discoveries were similar? How were they different? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you list the processes that were followed in the videos? Were the processes followed in the same order in both videos? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you think that there might be more than one path that could lead to a successful investigation? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Learn how chemist Percy Julian overcame prejudice and segregation to become one of the leading scientists of the 20th century. This interactive slideshow adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; documents milestones in Julian's life and career.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;From segregated schools in Alabama to a prestigious position and home in Chicago, this interactive slideshow adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; follows the life and career of renowned 20th century chemist Percy Julian, who gained international recognition in chemistry despite the tremendous educational and social obstacles that African Americans faced. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; Percy Julian was one of the great scientists of the 20th century. In a career spanning four decades, he made groundbreaking discoveries in chemistry, was awarded dozens of patents, and earned 18 honorary degrees as well as membership in the prestigious National Academy of Sciences&amp;mdash;only the second African American bestowed such an honor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it wasn't easy. Julian was born in 1899 in Montgomery, Alabama, during an era of legalized segregation. There were few black schools, and inadequate state funding left them overcrowded, in disrepair, and with far fewer resources than white schools. Few black schools went beyond the eighth grade. Moreover, white resistance to educating African Americans was immense. White supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan terrorized African Americans by burning schools, randomly beating and murdering teachers and students, and intimidating others from attending. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1916, Julian moved north to pursue his education. He attended high school and DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, graduating with honors, and went on to earn a master's degree from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Some colleges in the North accepted a handful of black students, but the social climate was unwelcoming and the opportunities limited, particularly for graduate studies. Ultimately, Julian moved to Europe to earn his Ph.D. in 1931.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he returned to the U.S., Julian became a full professor and chair of the Department of Chemistry at Howard University and the country's foremost black chemist. But Julian got caught up in a personal controversy, and was forced to resign. With nowhere else to go, he returned to DePauw as a researcher, where he took on a high-stakes project that would either secure or destroy his reputation as a chemist. He set out to synthesize a plant alkaloid called physostigmine, used to treat glaucoma. Julian succeeded, and chemists around the world recognized his elegant synthesis as a milestone in chemical history. Even so, it was difficult for Julian to advance. Traditionally white universities would not tolerate having an African American on their faculties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Julian turned to the chemical industry. Two companies&amp;mdash;DuPont and the Institute of Paper Chemistry in Wisconsin&amp;mdash;were on the verge of hiring Julian until they found out that he was black. Eventually, Julian was hired to run the chemical research lab for Glidden, a manufacturer of paints and other products, based in Chicago. In 1936, Julian became the first African American to hold such a position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Julian also became a role model for aspiring black chemists who would work for him. Indeed, the older he got, the more proactive Julian became as an advocate of civil rights. A seminal period for Julian came after he moved his family into the all-white Chicago neighborhood of Oak Park. Although many white residents supported and welcomed him, Julian also received death threats, and an arsonist tried to burn down his house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Julian joined the fair-housing movement in Oak Park and helped lead a national fundraising campaign for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, giving interviews and speeches about the plight of the black man in America. "Branded, first," Julian railed in one speech, "unfit to spend their money for food or drink in public places along with other Americans; denied the ballot and confined to ghettos that stifled hope and ambition, victims of murder of the mind, heart, and spirit&amp;mdash;this is the story of the American Negro."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until the end of his life, Julian continued to speak out against inequality and to serve as a role model for African Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about Percy Julian's education, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.soc.civil.tactics.education/"&gt;Getting an Education&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the racial violence that Percy Julian and his family experienced in Oak Park, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.soc.civil.people.oakpark/"&gt;Moving to Oak Park&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about Percy Julian's work, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.steroids/"&gt;Synthesizing a Steroid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.alkaloid/"&gt;Synthesizing an Alkaloid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/drey07.sci.phys.matter.cortisone/"&gt;Making Cortisone From Plants&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you find evidence to support the idea that Julian would have had a different experience pursing a scientific career today? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the information in these slides, how was Julian able to overcome racial barriers that existed in his time? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What made Julian an inspiration to other African Americans? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Julian overcame racial barriers earlier in his life, but only spoke out against racism later in his life. What information can you find to suggest why? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn about the sophisticated scientific instruments on two identical robotic rovers that have explored Mars &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;Spirit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Opportunity&lt;/em&gt;.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Unmanned space missions are able to explore the solar system in ways manned missions cannot. Equipped with scientific instruments such as telescopes, cameras, and spectrographs, robotic spacecraft are able to safely travel into space and radio back scientific data to researchers on Earth. In this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn in greater detail how each of the Mars Exploration Rovers that arrived on the "Red Planet" in 2004 was equipped to determine, among other things, whether water ever existed there.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;For several decades, robots have been produced to carry out an assortment of tasks, including assembly-line manufacturing jobs (e.g., spot-welding), aerial surveillance, and domestic chores (e.g., vacuuming the living room carpet). The programming for specific and fairly repetitive-action tasks such as these is relatively simple. But in more recent years, robot design has become far more sophisticated. Today, many robots are being designed to act autonomously &amp;mdash; that is, to react on their own to what they encounter in their environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003, the Mars Exploration Rover mission was launched with the goal of learning more about the geological history of that planet, particularly the role that liquid water may have played. To carry out this task, twin robots &amp;mdash; each the size of a golf cart &amp;mdash; were sent to Mars. These "rovers," named &lt;em&gt;Spirit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Opportunity&lt;/em&gt;, would be the first vehicles to roll across the surface of another planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help fulfill the mission's research goals, &lt;em&gt;Spirit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Opportunity&lt;/em&gt; were equipped with identical sets of custom-made scientific instruments, which included a panoramic camera to create high-resolution images and a spectrometer to determine mineralogy. Each rover also has a robotic arm to hold and manipulate miniature versions of instruments used by geologists on Earth, additional spectrometers to identify the elemental composition of rocks and soil, and a microscopic imager to enable close-up views of Martian features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rovers were also designed to exhibit great mobility over largely unknown terrain. Robotic engineers were challenged to develop wheels that were light enough to help keep down the weight of the spacecraft, compact enough to fit in the landing vehicle, and adaptable enough to allow the rover to maneuver off the lander and navigate around surface obstacles. Their solution? A flexible mobility system of six cleated, aluminum wheels, each 26 cm (10 in) in diameter, which enable the rover to traverse both sandy soil and rocks that are larger than the wheels' diameter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each rover was also designed with a jointed suspension system so that if one side of it climbed up over a rock, the other side went down to redistribute weight evenly over the all wheels and thereby prevent the possibility of tipping over. Despite &amp;mdash; and perhaps also because of &amp;mdash; their thoroughly considered design, the rovers could move at a maximum speed of only 5 cm/sec (2 in/sec).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the inhospitable conditions on Mars that the rovers were designed to withstand, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.hostenviron/"&gt;Mars Dead or Alive: A Hostile Environment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the history of space travel and why robotic surrogates offer a more practical option to manned missions, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.exptimeline/"&gt;Robotic Exploration of Space Timeline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose two parts of the rover. For each one, describe the job it was designed to do, the challenges for carrying out this job on Mars, and what you think is most interesting about this part of the rover.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does the rover get its instructions or commands? How does it share the images, data, and other information it gets with us on Earth?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These rovers move slowly! Can you move across the room at the same rate they do? Why do you think they move at this speed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, watch residents of the Peruvian Andes build a suspension bridge made entirely of grass.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;The ancient Inca were a textile society and thus skilled in working with natural fibers including alpaca and cotton. Still, it might surprise people today that their solution to crossing the canyons and gorges of their mountainous empire featured another fibrous material: grass. When you consider how they built a simple suspension bridge, you'll realize that not only was this a practical solution, it was also a safe one. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, watch residents of the Peruvian Andes as they build a traditional and functioning grass bridge &amp;mdash; the likes of which enabled the ancient Inca people to flourish for several hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Suspension bridges such as San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge and New York's Brooklyn Bridge are among the engineering wonders of the world. They owe their existence to a technological breakthrough: the development of high-tension steel from iron. But what do people do when the only material they have in abundance is grass? They use it. That's what the Inca people of what is now South America have done for hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, little more was known about traditional grass suspension bridges than that several hundred or more of these natural-fiber structures once spanned formidable obstacles &amp;mdash; the canyons and rivers of the Andes Mountains. These bridges enabled the Inca Empire, the largest empire of the pre-Industrial world, to flourish and to expand into new territory. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, they marveled at this technological achievement. The bridges, built from nothing more than braided grass and wood fibers, spanned distances longer than those of any bridges in Europe at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these structures were made from natural fibers, modern researchers know that they were more than just ropes thrown across canyons. Rather, they were engineered &amp;mdash; deliberately designed and built &amp;mdash; in much the same way that modern suspension bridges are. For the foundations, the Inca created pairs of stone abutments on either side of a crossing. These served as the anchors between which a roadway was suspended. As depicted in the video segment, which features the only Inca bridge crossing still in use, each of the four or more thick main cables that made up the roadway was actually a braid of three thinner cords. In turn, these thinner cords were each made up of two-dozen two-ply strands of grass that nearby villagers had twisted together by hand. The roadway was covered with a mat made of branches. Two additional cables served as protective handrails, which were secured to the roadway by vertical ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grass bridges tend to sag in the middle under their own weight and to sway in high winds, but despite their flimsy appearance, recent tests show that their design is structurally sound. In fact, they meet the benchmark for today's safety standard, which is to build a bridge three to four times stronger than the loads it will have to support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inca bridges, like Roman arch bridges, are examples of very successful bridge designs that have survived for centuries and continue to carry traffic today. Each of these bridge types was made using materials readily available to the people building them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how suspension bridges are designed to balance the forces that act on them, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.bbsuspension/"&gt;Clifton Suspension Bridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about arch bridges, which date back to the Roman Empire, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.bbarch/"&gt;Arch Bridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construct suspension cables out of newspaper in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2404_sle1inca.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did you ever think that grass could be strong enough for building a bridge? How did the Inca work with grass to make it strong enough?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think the Inca chose grass as the material for building their bridge?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What constraints did the Inca have in solving their design problem? (limited materials, 150-foot width to cross)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compare suspension bridges that you have crossed to the one made by the Inca. How are they similar? How are they different? What material is the bridge that you crossed made of and why do you think the engineers chose this material? How are engineers influenced in their bridge designs by what will have to cross the bridge?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Using automobile crash test footage, this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; shows some of the challenges in designing the air bag.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Do you need proof that driving is a dangerous activity? More Americans have died in car crashes over the past 100 years than in all the wars the U.S. has ever fought combined. More than 40,000 Americans die each year on the nation's highways, most as the result of high-speed collisions. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn how engineers developed the air bag, an important automobile-safety device now found in most cars.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The next time you're riding in a car, think about this: Almost every new car today is equipped with safety belts, shatterproof glass, padded dashboards, front and rear bumpers, anti-lock brakes, and crumple zones &amp;mdash; each engineered and tested to perform to high standards established by government safety boards. Judging by this built-in redundancy, it is clear that many safety devices must work in concert with one another to achieve the desired safety goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As described in this video segment, air bags, another now-common safety feature, are a type of passive restraint system, meaning they restrain motorists without the people in the car actively doing anything. Air bags were conceived at a time when fewer than 15% of all U.S. drivers and passengers wore safety belts. The government, concerned by the high rate of highway fatalities, pressured automakers to build more safety features into their vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can an air bag prevent serious injury? In order to answer this question, it is necessary to understand what happens in a motor vehicle collision. According to Newton's laws of motion, an object moving at a constant velocity continues at the same velocity unless an external force acts upon it. Applied to a car crash, a body inside the car continues moving forward at the same velocity as the car was moving prior to impact. It stops only when it hits some object in the car, such as the steering wheel or dashboard. When the force of impact is large enough, injuries occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An air bag protects a passenger by applying a significantly smaller restraining force to the body than it would have experienced if it hit the dashboard or steering wheel unprotected. Additionally, an air bag helps reduce injuries by distributing the force of the collision over a larger area, thus lessening the force on any particular part of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as real-world data showed early safety-belt designers that their invention sometimes caused more damage than it prevented, air bag engineers learned that the explosive force of a rapidly expanding air bag was powerful enough to injure and even kill smaller adults and children. So they went back to the drawing board and designed a smarter system. Early air bags inflated with a specified force and were tested exclusively on adult-sized male dummies, but new computerized systems have sensors that take into account the force of impact, the size of the passenger, and even whether the seat belts are engaged. Based on these data, computer calculations determine whether or not deployment is required, whether a bag should deploy from the front or from the side, and how forceful the deployment should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the steps of the engineering design process, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.engin.design.desprocess/"&gt;What Is the Design Process?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about how bicycle helmets offer protection to arguably our most critical organ, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.zhelmet/"&gt;Balloon Brain: Designing a Helmet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design a study of local seat belt use in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2605_escacar.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, hydrogen fuel cell cars promise pollution-free driving, but will we see them anytime soon?</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Imagine if we could find a non-polluting, highly efficient source of power for our society's energy needs. One technology &amp;mdash; the fuel cell &amp;mdash; offers a strong and proven model. However, in order for the fuel cell to replace gas-powered engines and batteries, the fuel used to power it must be readily available. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; highlights the electrochemical reaction that takes place within a hydrogen fuel cell and explores the challenges of producing the pure hydrogen that fuels it.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Although carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a naturally occurring and non-toxic gas, human activities have increased its concentration in the atmosphere far beyond natural levels. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a greenhouse gas. It allows solar radiation to pass through the atmosphere and be absorbed by Earth's surface but prevents the energy that is reradiated from escaping back into space. The burning of fossil fuels, which releases the energy we use to power our cars &amp;mdash; and many other things &amp;mdash; is widely believed to be the primary culprit behind the recent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen is a potential alternative source of energy for vehicles, portable electronics, and even home power generators. Hydrogen can be used as an energy source for fuel cells, which, like gasoline engines and household batteries, are a type of energy conversion device. However, unlike engines and batteries, fuel cells don't produce harmful emissions, and they don't "go dead." With a fuel cell, as long as there is a flow of the chemical elements hydrogen and oxygen into the cell, electricity will flow out of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuel cells designed to run on hydrogen combine hydrogen with free oxygen in the air and produce water. Electricity is released during the reaction. Because hydrogen fuel cells produce energy with no harm to the environment &amp;mdash; water and heat are the only by-products &amp;mdash; it has been touted as a replacement for the internal combustion engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although hydrogen is abundant on Earth, it is combined with other molecules in some other form &amp;mdash; such as with oxygen as water. Because a fuel cell requires pure hydrogen, the great technological challenge is to separate hydrogen from other molecules for use. Even though scientists and engineers have proven they can remove hydrogen from water, the separation process requires a great deal of energy that must be provided by another fuel source. Using natural gas or coal for this purpose would, of course, produce more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions &amp;mdash; precisely what fuel cells are designed to lessen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-polluting, renewable sources of energy, including solar cells, wind turbines, or hydroelectric dams, might one day fuel the hydrogen extraction process. But such a solution has not yet proven to be efficient &amp;mdash; more energy is spent than is generated. In 2004, Iceland opened its first commercial hydrogen filling station. Iceland already derives 90 percent of its electricity from turbines driven by steam from renewable hot water springs that originate deep underground. Iceland's government has committed to powering its cars and fishing fleet with cleanly produced hydrogen within the next 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about fuel cells and the many challenges hydrogen poses, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.hydrogencar/"&gt;Global Warming: The Hydrogen Car&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about geothermal features, including hot springs, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.yellowstone/"&gt;A Visit to Yellowstone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how astronomy has evolved, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.galileosys/"&gt;Galileo: Sun-Centered System&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/viewing/3210_01_nsn.html" target="_blank"&gt;viewing ideas on NOVA Teachers&lt;/a&gt; for this video segment.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how a fuel cell works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compare the gasoline engine now common in cars with fuel cells. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you think that researching how to obtain a pure source of hydrogen for fuel cells is a good investment? Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do research to find out and compare the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; given off by vehicles and by power plants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should we be trying to use fuel cells in cars and other vehicles, or is there another more important way that we should be using fuel cells to reduce the burning of hydrocarbons? Explain your answer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Featuring slow-motion footage of insects in flight, this video adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; explores the engineering challenge of designing a robotic aerial vehicle that flies like a bug.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;During the process of evolution, the survival of plant and animal species depends upon their ability to successfully adapt to different challenges in life. Is it far-fetched, then, to look for lessons in nature that might be applied to some of the challenges we face in technology? In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, engineers are studying insect flight and hoping to gain insights into ways of designing and developing miniature flying vehicles that we may one day use for a variety of purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Engineering design solutions draw inspiration from many sources. For example, did you know that the Wright brothers were bird watchers and that they modeled their airplane wing after a bird's wing? Biomimicry, a word derived from &lt;em&gt;bios&lt;/em&gt;, meaning "life," and mimesis, meaning "to imitate," refers to the study of nature's most successful developments and the imitation of natural designs and processes in the solving of human problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to control an unpiloted aircraft from remote locations offers numerous advantages. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can fly at higher altitudes for longer time periods than can piloted craft, and they can perform high-speed evasive maneuvers, the forces of which would stretch a person beyond his or her physical limitations. In certain difficult phases of flight, such as low-level night flying over uneven terrain or bad-weather landings, computerized control systems are able to maneuver aircraft more reliably than manual systems can. However, a UAV's size and fixed-wing design limit its ability to perform certain military objectives such as spying, as well as to collect data and perform certain commercial functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using insights gained through observing insect flight, aeronautical engineers have designed a class of miniature unmanned aerial vehicles (MAVs) that may overcome these limitations. Scientists have found insect flight to be a good motion to mimic for several reasons. Flapping wings allow insects and birds to take off and land in a standing position, fly at low speeds, hover, make sharp turns, and even fly backward. The physical limitations of fixed-wing designs prohibit conventional aircraft from doing any of these things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed-wing and flapping-wing designs differ in how they create lift. Fixed-wing aircraft rely on lift generated by the vehicle moving through the air. Because lift is directly proportional to wing area and the velocity of air flow over the wing, the smaller the wings, the less lift they can supply. Most aircraft designs counter this effect by increasing the velocity of the vehicle. By contrast, a flapping-wing design relies on lift generated by both vehicle speed and wing flapping. So, if engineers wanted a smaller aircraft to fly, they would only need to increase the frequency of the flapping to keep the aircraft aloft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to military reconnaissance, MAVs could be used in search-and-rescue missions and for mapping dangerous areas, such as the interiors of collapsed buildings. MAVs could also assist in traffic reporting, wildlife surveys, and scores of other applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about biomimicry, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/eng06.sci.engin.design.biomimicry/"&gt;Design Inspired by Nature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the history of UAVs, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.engin.design.uavs/"&gt;Pilotless Flight: Timeline of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the principles of powered flight, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.airfoil/"&gt;Aerodynamics: What Causes Lift?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explore some of the challenges associated with building extremely small aircraft in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3001_spiesfly.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, cars drive themselves. Teams of designers using different technologies compete for a two-million-dollar prize to see which unmanned vehicle will make it to the finish line first.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Creating a robot capable of safely navigating its environment without human intervention has been a goal of engineers ever since they first conceived of robots nearly 50 years ago. Despite rapid advancements in technology, however, engineers did not succeed in the task of designing autonomous robots until recently. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; follows two teams as they push their engineering design skills to the limit to develop systems that allow cars to drive themselves in the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Most of us take for granted our ability to sense details in our environment and to identify and traverse safe routes through a world riddled with hazards. What's more, we perform this amazing process instantly and automatically. Robotics engineers know that for a robot to analyze and respond to even a fraction of the information about the environment that our brains process, it must have some of the most advanced computer hardware and software available. Take, for example, the twin exploratory rovers that landed on Mars early in 2004. After more than two years on the Red Planet, each rover had traveled only about three kilometers (1.8 miles) without human assistance. Yet it took engineers years to develop the computer software and hardware for these complex robots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge demanded a much faster pace than that held by the Mars rovers. The engineering teams that took part in the challenge had to develop autonomous vehicles that could cover the 210-kilometer (130-mile) course in the fastest time possible. Despite the distinct advantage of operating their vehicles on Earth, no team had come even close to completing the racecourse in the previous year. Nevertheless, twelve teams put their designs to the test in the 2005 challenge. Five would actually finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teams that completed the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge course all used a combination of sensing technologies that measured the surrounding environment. Their equipment included stereo-vision cameras, laser range finders, and radar. However, perhaps more important than the equipment each used to sense the environment was the computer hardware and software that compiled and analyzed incoming data to create a picture of the road and the hazards that lay ahead of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team that won the challenge by a margin of 11 minutes over the second place robot used adaptive vision software to combine data from five laser range finders, one video camera, and radar. This program created what the team called a "cost map" in which hazards were color-coded relative to their risk or potential cost to the robot. In addition, the winning team's software enabled the robot to learn over time so that it could replicate its successes and avoid previous missteps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one yet knows how the innovations developed during the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge will impact society, but we can all speculate. Potentially, autonomous vehicles may be more reliable than those piloted by drowsy, overworked, or distracted human drivers. Such vehicles may also allow commuters to be more productive as they travel to and from work. In addition, efforts to develop autonomous vehicles that operate reliably on Earth will surely speed efforts to improve autonomous navigation on unmanned spacecraft sent to explore other planets. Such advances will enable these missions to cover far more ground than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about remote sensing technologies, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.sonar/"&gt;Sound Waves Underwater: Experiment with Sonar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.boatnv/"&gt;Collecting Data Below the Earth's Surface&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.lochness/"&gt;Sound Waves Underwater: The Loch Ness Monster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the Mars robotic rovers, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/eng06.sci.engin.design.rover/"&gt;Anatomy of a Rover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.hostenviron/"&gt;Mars Dead or Alive: A Hostile Environment&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.wheretoland/"&gt;Mars Dead or Alive: Where to Land?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the history of robots in space, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.exptimeline/"&gt;Robotic Exploration of Space Timeline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design, build, and test a rubber band-powered car in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3308_darpa.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; explains how the sprinkler revolutionized fire safety and also features developments in fire-safety design for high-rise buildings.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;The goals of fire safety are clear: protect people, the structure, and the structure's contents. When planning a new building or retrofitting an existing one, it is the responsibility of structural engineers to create a design that will accomplish these goals. Their challenge is to incorporate into the building design a reliable means for evacuation and a system to control the fire's spread in the event that a fire does break out. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn how an old technology &amp;mdash; fire sprinklers &amp;mdash; and new computer systems can work together to help prevent fires large and small from turning modern multi-story buildings into towering infernos.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Today's city skylines are impressive, but the multi-story buildings that comprise them present an enormous challenge to emergency responders. Upper floors are generally inaccessible to fire crews arriving in the "hook-and-ladder" vehicles conventionally used to douse flames. Considering the number of building occupants and the quantity of valuable contents, rescue plans that involve climbing up and down stairs aren't a viable option. The best way to defeat fire in these buildings is to quickly and reliably prevent its spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fire protection engineering is the application of science and engineering principles to the protection of people and property from destructive fire. The most effective means that fire protection engineers have to prevent a potentially lethal and destructive multi-story blaze from developing is the modern version of a technology that has been around for nearly 150 years: a fire sprinkler system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until the 1940s, sprinklers were installed almost exclusively for the protection of commercial warehouses and factories. But as fire and building officials began comparing the safety records of buildings with and without sprinklers, sprinkler systems eventually became mandatory safety equipment in most public buildings, including hospitals, schools, and hotels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon detecting a fire, fire sprinkler systems immediately activate to control the fire's spread. These systems are reliable because they are simple. Fire sprinklers have no moving parts. A connector is placed every few feet along a water supply pipe to allow water to flow out. The fire sprinkler acts as a plug to hold the water in until it is needed. When heat from a fire reaches the sprinkler, a built-in heat-sensitive trigger &amp;mdash; usually a glass tube filled with liquid or a solder link &amp;mdash; ruptures, releasing the water. Because fire sprinklers are heat-activated, only those sprinklers closest to a fire activate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of fires in buildings with sprinklers are controlled by just one or two sprinklers that release water at a rate of about 25 gallons per minute. That's nothing compared with the hundreds or thousands of gallons per minute that firefighters spray to extinguish a fire. The greatest testament to the effectiveness of fire sprinklers is that there have never been multiple deaths from a fire in a building with a proper sprinkler system. Nevertheless, only 40% of high-rise buildings and less than 2% of homes have fire sprinkler systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research and analyze fire safety strategies in public and private buildings in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2604_escafire.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The engineering design process begins with a problem human beings want to solve. What problem did Henry Parmelee want to solve almost 150 years ago? What was his solution?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did Henry Parmelee's understanding of the nature of materials help him come up with a sprinkler head as a solution to his problem?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What problems do fire fighters face when fire breaks out in a high-rise building? What solutions to these challenges did you learn about in this video segment?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can computers help test design solutions?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think someone would not put a fire sprinkler system into a high-rise building? (cost)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; features the youngest rock formations in the Grand Canyon, lava dams, and how they are subject to the eroding power of water.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; shows a dramatic landscape created by relatively recent rock-forming activity in the Grand Canyon. Volcanic eruptions only a million years ago created the canyon's youngest rocks. In contrast with the much older Vishnu Schist formation, this younger rock has been much more susceptible to physical change. When three-hundred-meter (thousand-foot) lava dams periodically blocked the river, they were quickly eroded away and river flow restored.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Although the rocks exposed in its walls are ancient -- some nearly two billion years old -- the Grand Canyon itself is relatively young. Most scientists believe it started to form only five to six million years ago. In the past 250 million years, the only significant rock-forming activities in the area were the sporadic volcanic eruptions that began about six million years ago and continued until several thousand years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earth's crust is composed of minerals that form rocks. Igneous rocks -- from the Latin word for "fire" -- solidify from hot, molten material called magma. Certain igneous rocks, such as granite, cool slowly beneath the ground, producing relatively large crystals. These rocks, called intrusive rocks, are exposed at the surface through uplifting processes like mountain building, or as the result of deep erosion. Magma that erupts onto the surface, known as lava, cools very rapidly, so its atoms do not arrange into crystals. Lava forms extrusive igneous rocks such as basalt, the grains of which are so small they may be invisible to the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The properties and composition of extrusive rocks vary according to the properties and content of the magma from which they were derived. Silica-poor magmas, such as basalt, have low viscosities and high temperatures. Consequently, they are very fluid on eruption and harden to form dark, fine-grained rock. Silica-rich magmas are more viscous. Many silica-rich magmas reach the surface with high contents of water, carbon dioxide, and other gases, and violently spew out lava as airborne pumice and ash. Others, however, lose their gases during ascent and produce thick, slow-moving lava flows that harden as thick deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basalt deposits in the western part of the Grand Canyon provide evidence that volcanoes were active there in the past. In fact, scientists know that the Colorado River was dammed at least a dozen times from 1.8 million to 400,000 years ago. Lava cascaded down adjacent side canyons and hardened, and temporary lakes formed behind lava dams that sometimes reached upward of 300 meters (about 1,000 feet) in height -- not unlike how Lake Mead and Lake Powell formed behind the Hoover and Glen Canyon dams. However, each of these natural dams was eventually breached in a testament to the river's erosive power. Relative-age dating and known erosion rates suggest it took about 20,000 years for each dam to form and then be eroded away by the river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about the Grand Canyon's oldest rocks, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.vishnu/"&gt;The Grand Canyon: Ancient Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how man-made dams are constructed to both withstand the forces and harness the power of rushing water, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.bbhooverdam/"&gt;Hoover Dam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.hooverelec/"&gt;Hoover Dam and Hydroelectric Power&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; uses animation to present the theory of how the Grand Canyon was formed and features rare footage of a phenomenon known as debris flow.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Today, in the deepest part of the Grand Canyon, the Colorado River flows past rocks that are 1.7 billion years old. As described in this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, the erosive action of water in the river is responsible for deepening the main channel, but other forces, in particular debris flows, caused the widening of the canyon. Gathering speed and volume, piles of loose rock and soil that originate in a river's tributaries merge to form powerfully erosive debris flows, which are capable of dramatically affecting the surrounding terrain.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Rivers are a powerful erosive force. Over time, they wear down even the tallest mountains and carry away the physical evidence that the mountains once stood. Powered by the force of gravity, the world's rivers deliver about 20 billion tons of rock and soil to the oceans each year. Depending on the coarseness and volume of sediments they carry and the speed at which they move, rivers erode their channels at different rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erosive forces continue to shape the Grand Canyon today, millions of years after it began to form. Normal channel erosion alone, however, cannot explain the many kilometers that separate its rims. The strongest explanation holds that the major factor in the widening of the canyon has been activity from tributary drainage systems -- the side streams, rivulets, and gullies outside the main river channel. The greatest erosive force in these tributaries is the fast-moving landslide called a debris flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debris flows result when flash flooding from intense rainfall or rapid snowmelt moves loose rock and boulders down canyon walls and side channels. Debris flows are particularly likely to occur in desert conditions, where the hard-baked soil and scarcity of deep-rooted vegetation do little to absorb water or hold rocks in place during heavy rains. Piles of loose soil and rock that collect in a channel are picked up by the water and carried quickly downstream. The action of the debris tears away at the banks and bed of the river, thus widening the surrounding canyon. The faster the water moves the more debris it carries and the more erosive the debris flow becomes. Debris flows, which may resemble a river of concrete more than a river of water, can carry car-sized boulders and travel a mile or more, depending on the terrain. When they reach more level ground and the flow stops, thick deposits form over a broad area. The size of the deposits downstream reflects the extent to which erosion has occurred upstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 36 Colorado River tributaries recently studied, all had characteristic debris-flow deposits. Nearly 60 percent showed evidence of debris-flow activity during the last 25 years. Composed of 10 to 40 percent sand by weight, debris flows in the Grand Canyon transport much of the sediment that builds beaches along the river. Large boulders transported by debris flows may also create or change its rapids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about rivers and other erosive agents that shape the Earth's surface, and to see some dramatic examples of erosion in the world, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.erosion/"&gt;Erosion and Weathering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.natwonders/"&gt;Natural Wonders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how the sediment carried by rivers like the Colorado River nourishes soils and helps build deltas and other valuable downstream land forms, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.flooderosion/"&gt;Flood: Farming and Erosion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.missdelta/"&gt;The Mississippi River Delta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although the Colorado River has obviously cut down through the layers of rock, why were scientists unsure that this explained how some areas of the Grand Canyon formed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What clues suggest that the river acts as a "freight train" carrying rock out through the Grand Canyon?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What type of event would trigger a debris flow such as the one shown in the video?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do scientists explain the observation that the Grand Canyon is far wider than the river itself?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design an experiment in which you can demonstrate the erosive nature of moving water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have access to a stream table, make a model that shows how water flowing through a side canyon can sweep debris into a main river, which washes it away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; chronicles the discoveries that led to a radical new theory in which living organisms, not just geological processes, play an active role in cave formation.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;The most common process by which limestone caves form involves carbonic acid &amp;mdash; or weakly acidic groundwater &amp;mdash; as the primary agent. When carbonic acid contacts limestone, it dissolves minerals in the rock. If enough water to saturate the rock is present over a long time period, cavities and entire underground cave networks can form. Recently, a radical new theory has been proposed that identifies another cave-forming agent: sulfuric acid. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; identifies the mysterious source of the sulfuric acid, which, unlike carbonic acid, does not readily form in nature.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;As certain chemical elements cycle through an ecosystem, they interact with both living (bio-) and nonliving (geo-) components of the ecosystem. These elements are recycled within the system in what are known as biogeochemical cycles. Sometimes, however, they are stored for long periods of time outside the pathway in what is called a sink. Examples of carbon sinks include rainforests and caves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biogeochemical cycles and atmospheric changes are often linked. Global warming, for example, is a disturbance caused by deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels, which together have altered the carbon balance in the atmosphere. But biogeochemical cycles can also shape the very ground on which we walk. When plants and animals die, their organic compounds combine with oxygen, and the compounds decay. The fraction of compounds that isn't oxidized can, over millions of years, form deposits that convert to coal, petroleum, or peat. Also, shells of dead aquatic animals accumulate on the sea floor and are compressed over time to form limestone, a common surface rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solution caves are typically formed by a chemical reaction between limestone and groundwater that has become slightly acidified through contact with the carbon dioxide present in most soils. The acidified groundwater &amp;mdash; called carbonic acid &amp;mdash; gradually dissolves away minerals as it invades cracks in the rock. If enough water is available, narrow openings can slowly widen into large cavities and passages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a radical new theory suggests an agent other than carbonic acid may be responsible for creating some of the largest cave systems in the world. Scientists have discovered that sulfur, not carbon, was responsible for carving out massive cavities from the limestone rock of Capitan Reef, the fossil reef that contains New Mexico's Carlsbad Caverns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain bacteria convert organic sulfur found in oil to hydrogen sulfide gas. Several million years ago, when this gas escaped from oil deposits underlying Capitan Reef, it mixed with oxygen in the groundwater supplies and produced sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is capable of dissolving vast amounts of limestone minerals &amp;mdash; far more than carbonic acid can &amp;mdash; and enough to explain the size of Big Room, which is featured in this video segment. As Capitan Reef uplifted little by little from its origins below sea level, the level of the water table dropped in relation to the land surface. The acidic groundwater drained away to reveal a dissolved cave system with large gypsum deposits, a telltale by-product of a reaction between sulfuric acid and limestone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the processes that produce different cave types, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.caveform/"&gt;How Caves Form&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about deposits, including gypsum, that form in caves, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.virtmap/"&gt;Virtual Cave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are two lines of evidence that caused scientists to question the prevailing theory of cave formation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What evidence caused scientists to suggest that sulfuric acid was the substance that resulted in the formation of these caves?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does the narrator mean when he says, "life itself was helping to shape the world beneath our feet"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; shows four different ways in which caves are formed: by rainwater, waves, lava, and bacteria.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Caves are cavities that form in hillsides, in cliff walls, and underground, and are accessible at Earth's surface. Typically, they form in soft, fractured, or soluble rock as a result of natural mechanical and chemical processes that continue over thousands of years. This interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; offers animated explanations for how ocean waves, lava, slightly acidic groundwater, and, in a supporting role, microbes account for the variety of cave formations on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;One-seventh of the world's land surface lies atop landscapes characterized by grooved rock pavements, streams that disappear underground, and scattered circular depressions called sinkholes. This type of topography is known as karst terrain -- terrain in which land formations result primarily from groundwater dissolving minerals in the rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas ocean waves carve sea caves out of rock faces through unrelenting physical action, and lava caves are the empty tubes where molten rock once flowed, most underground caves are formed by the dissolution of soluble rock by water. Slightly acidic groundwater does its damage by slowly dissolving limestone. The result is a subterranean environment consisting of caverns and networks of smaller, interconnecting chambers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caves offer a unique habitat for rare flora and fauna, whose study has contributed to our knowledge of biological adaptation and evolution. One type of animal that has adapted to life in the dark zones of caves is the sightless troglobite, some species of which have evolved extra-long sensory antennae atop their heads for finding their way around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caves, and, more broadly, karst terrain, also hold much in the way of human, economic, and scientific value. Their underground springs provide fresh water for domestic and agricultural use, and many are mined for mineral resources such as marble, salt, and even guano, or bat excrement, a source of phosphate and an effective organic fertilizer. Additionally, several million visitors pass through karst regions each year to witness their aesthetic beauty and to simply explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For scientists, caves offer opportunities for different kinds of exploration. In medical research, the study of extremophiles -- organisms that that live in conditions outside of a normal range of temperature or pH balance -- is a growing area of interest. Several cave dwelling species are presently being tested for their ability to combat cancer and malaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unregulated and relatively fast flow of water through caves and other karst features provides little opportunity for natural filtering to occur. As a result, karst systems are especially sensitive to environmental disturbances, such as siltation and disease transmission. Because the integrity of any karst system is dependent on both water and land, an effective conservation policy is one that provides comprehensive protection of natural water, airflow, and humidity conditions through caves and their wider catchments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about the different depositional features that form in solution caves and lava tubes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.virtmap/"&gt;Virtual Cave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.lavatube/"&gt;Virtual Lava Tube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the coastal processes that drive sea cave formation, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.coastrock/"&gt;Rocky Coasts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the process through which underground caves form, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.caveintro/"&gt;Caves and Karst&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about cave-dwelling microbes and their impact on cave formation, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.lifecondtn/"&gt;Caves: Extreme Conditions for Life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.cavebiogeo/"&gt;Cave Formation: Biogeochemical Cycles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>What happens when the ground under your feet is ice and it's moving? This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; features some of the dangers faced by scientists conducting research in Antarctica.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;For many scientists, having the opportunity to work in Antarctica is a dream come true. Its remoteness and extreme environment make it, arguably, the most untouched region on the planet. Today, more than 20 nations maintain research facilities there under a treaty that dedicates the entire continent to peaceful scientific investigation. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, see how the members of one research team cope with the inhospitable climate and other environmental hazards during their stay.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Due to its polar location and high average elevation, all but a small part of Antarctica remains below freezing all year round. So perhaps it's not surprising that Antarctica's only native land animals are tiny invertebrates &amp;mdash; mites, ticks, and nematode worms &amp;mdash; that have natural antifreeze in their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the difficult conditions, more than 4,000 people work on the continent in the summer, and 1,000 brave the dark winter. Although a few of the 40 or so permanent research stations feature private rooms and many modern conveniences, some are little more than huts offering only the most basic shelter for scientists and support personnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While early investigators in Antarctica were primarily concerned with mapping the continent and monitoring the weather, modern-day researchers engage in activities across diverse scientific fields. In addition to high-profile studies of the ozone layer and global warming, other subjects are being examined. For example, buried under a sheet of ice that in some places is three miles thick are geographic features similar to those of other continents &amp;mdash; including mountain ranges, canyons, high plateaus, and lowland plains. The ice itself contains a climate record dating back 500,000 years or more, and mountaintops rising through the ice can expose fossils dating back 200 million years when Antarctica was still a central part of the ancient supercontinent Gondwanaland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oceanographers study the currents that form in the cold southern ocean that surrounds Antarctica and affect both marine ecosystems and Earth's climate patterns; astronomers observe the universe through some of the planet's clearest air; and biologists study plants, animals, and microorganisms to see how they have adapted for life in such harsh conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work comes with its share of hazards. In addition to the extreme cold, snow kicked up by wind can easily disorient field researchers. What's more, large regions of ice sheets, called ice streams, move so fast that friction causes large cracks, or crevasses to open up in the ice. The crevasses can be 50 feet wide and more than 100 feet deep. Snow-covered crevasses can easily swallow up people and the equipment they operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about what scientists are learning about the nature and speed of ice sheet movement in Antarctica, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.icesheets/"&gt;Antarctic Ice Movement: Part I&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about ice streams, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.icestreams/"&gt;Antarctic Ice Movement: Part II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about other types of challenging work done by scientists, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.hardhat/"&gt;Astronauts in Hard Hats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plan a survival pack for severe Antarctic weather in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2508_warnings.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the conditions in Antarctica in the summer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why are the scientists there?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are some survival strategies scientists in Antarctica need to know?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are crevasses and why are they dangerous?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is incredible to see what scientists sometimes go through for their studies of Earth. Name some other examples of Earth scientists going above and beyond, and even into danger, to collect data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, scientists search for carbonized remains of plants preserved in lava flows to find out how long it has taken rain forests on Hawaiʻi to regenerate after a volcanic eruption.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of thousands of years, lava flows have created intricate patterns on the slopes of Hawaiʻi's Mauna Loa volcano. Until the mid-1970s, it was impossible to know when each of the flows occurred. However, as this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes, scientists are now using tiny artifacts of life encased in hardened lava flows to piece together the mountain's complex geological and biological history.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Flowing lava erases nearly everything in its path. An entire forest can be wiped out by streams of molten rock. In some circumstances however, a flow may encase a small amount of plant material before it is entirely incinerated. Starved of the oxygen required for combustion, these bits of organic material are preserved inside the cooling lava. When geologists find these artifacts, they can use them to date the lava flows that contain them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geologists use two main techniques to determine the age of objects they find. Relative- age dating compares past geologic events based on where objects appear relative to one another in layers, or strata, of rock. In contrast, absolute-age dating provides an accurate estimate of an object's actual age. This technique, also called radiometric dating, measures the stage of decay of specific radioactive isotopes contained in the object. Depending on which isotope is analyzed, objects from several billion years old to just a few thousand years old can be accurately dated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists use radiocarbon dating, a radiometric dating analysis of carbon isotopes, to date objects that are 60,000 years old or less. This technique provides very accurate age estimates of relatively young objects. However, it can only be used to date objects that were once alive. It cannot be used to date rocks, unless those rocks happen to contain organic material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiocarbon dating relies on an understanding that some isotopes of carbon are radioactive and decay at constant rates over time. These unstable isotopes lose particles from their nuclei, thus becoming different elements. Living plants exchange their carbon with the carbon in the air. The air contains mostly carbon-12, the most common carbon isotope. However, it also contains small amounts of other isotopes, including carbon-14, a radioactive isotope produced in the atmosphere when cosmic rays bombard nitrogen atoms. All living plants -- and all organisms that depend on plants -- contain these two isotopes in a known ratio. After an organism's death, its carbon-12 content remains constant. However, its carbon-14 content decreases because carbon-14 is radioactive and slowly decays into nitrogen. Hence, the ratio of the two isotopes changes over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730 years, which means that in 5,730 years, half of the original carbon-14 atoms will have changed to nitrogen. Scientists rely on other data sources, such as tree rings, to estimate variations in carbon-14 concentrations over time. They use these estimates to interpret the ratio of carbon-12 and carbon-14 and ultimately to produce an accurate date of death for an organic object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how volcanoes have created the Hawaiian Islands, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.hawaii/"&gt;Plate Tectonics: The Hawaiian Archipelago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do volcanic eruptions affect life on land?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does the scientist determine which lava flows are older?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In this video, how old was the plant root? How old is the lava surrounding the plant? Is the lava below this flow younger or older than the plant?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What method was used to date the plant remains found in the lava in this video?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think that plants grow so fast on Mauna Loa? What is the significance of learning that the forests are only hundreds of years old rather than thousands of years old? What evidence is there that volcanic soil is more fertile than other soils?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, recent archeological evidence leads scientists to revise existing theories about human migrations into the Americas around the time of the last ice age.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Who were the first Americans, when did they arrive, and from where did they come? With limited evidence, scientists have long proposed a hypothesis that linked the migration route and the timing of the migration these ancient people to the end of the last ice age. However, new evidence suggests that this widely accepted hypothesis needs revision. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes how archaeologists are using this new evidence to develop a better understanding of the founding of the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Before the arrival of Europeans in the Americas in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, Native Americans had occupied these continents for thousands of years. The oldest human remains and artifacts found in North America are dated to about 11,500 years old. This age roughly coincides with the end of the last ice age. For many years, the similarity in timing was thought to explain the origin of the first Americans. However, human settlements have been discovered in South America that predate access to an inland migration route, suggesting that new hypotheses about the earliest human migration into the Americas must be considered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between about 65,000 and 10,000 years ago, during Earth's most recent era of global cooling, the Pleistocene, temperatures were on average five degrees Celsius (nine degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than they are today. This decrease in temperature led to greater amounts of precipitation falling as snow, which caused glaciers to become widespread over high latitudes. This, in turn, caused sea levels to drop and exposed relatively shallow continental shelves, including the shelf connecting Asia with Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, the leading hypothesis proposed that Pleistocene hunters crossed the 1,500-km-wide (932-mi) Bering land bridge in pursuit of large game animals, such as mammoths and musk oxen. From there, these ancient hunters were thought to have benefited from the timely retreat of the glaciers and an ice-free corridor through west-central Canada and into the rest of North America. However, recent evidence suggests that this ice-free corridor may have remained closed until about 11,000 years ago, 500 years later than evidence places people much further south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, recent archaeological finds in Chile and Venezuela provide evidence that there were people in South America as early as 12,500 years ago. In coastal areas of Alaska, scientists have found remains of land and sea mammals, as well as birds and fish, dating as far back as 13,000 years ago, suggesting that people paddling small boats along the coast en route to the Americas might have had sufficient resources to survive. In light of these new pieces of evidence, some archaeologists propose that early migration from Asia to the Americas may have taken place along the coasts, rather than further inland. To date, however, scientists have found no evidence of human settlements from this important time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Earth's early climate history, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.climatechange/"&gt;Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.greenland/"&gt;Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2: A Record of Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is sea level lowered during an ice age?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scientists sometimes need to revise a theory in the light of new evidence. Explain how the discovery of 12,000-year-old tools in South America caused scientists to rethink their explanation of human migration to the Americas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does fossil evidence indicating that bears survived the last ice age contribute to ideas about human migration in North America?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you think it is possible that if bears could have survived the Ice Age, humans could too? Explain your answer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, a meteorologist explains how an unusual weather pattern led to one of the most devastating floods of this century.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;During a typical year, levees built along the banks of the Mississippi River keep the river in its channel and out of people's homes and fields. However, 1993 was anything but a typical summer. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes the meteorological conditions that created what was then the costliest flood in United States history.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The Mississippi River is the sixth largest river in the world, pouring an average of 173,600 cubic meters (227,000 cubic yards) of water per second into the Gulf of Mexico. As with most rivers, the rate of the Mississippi's flow varies seasonally. Generally, it carries far more water between March and May than it does in late summer. In July of 1993, however, the upper parts of the river and its tributaries reached levels far in excess of those anticipated by the engineers who designed the levees built to contain the rivers. As a result, the river system flooded communities in nine Midwestern states and left more than 50,000 homes damaged or destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Great Flood of 1993, as it is now called, ranks as one of the worst natural disasters and one of the costliest floods in United States history. Even so, some have called it a leisurely disaster because it resulted not from a single storm, but from an anomalous weather pattern that took shape and remained in place for months during the summer of 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most thunderstorms form near surface frontal features, such as a cold front, that are associated with the polar jet stream. This high-speed band of wind travels in the atmosphere about 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles) above Earth. It typically occurs above the boundary between warm, tropical air masses to the south and cooler air masses to the north. In the summer, the air mass on the tropical side may be moist and unstable, thus triggering thunderstorms. These thunderstorms may develop into long-lived clusters, or convective systems, near the jet stream. Thus, the position of the jet stream is a good predictor of where convective systems will form and to where they will travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, the jet stream's course undulates, changing position over a period of days or weeks. For much of the summer of 1993, however, the jet stream remained almost stationary over the Great Plains and upper Midwest. A high-pressure system to the south provided a constant source of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, and evaporation from the saturated soil surface provided even more moisture to the already unstable air mass. When this moist, unstable air mass intersected with the cooler, drier air mass to the north, thunderstorms occurred. In some areas, this endless parade of thunderstorms dumped nearly 100 centimeters (more than 3 feet) of rain during the month of July. This heavy precipitation fell onto soil already saturated from a typically wet spring and had nowhere to go but into the rising waters of the Mississippi River basin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn how some farming practices increase the risk of flooding, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.flooderosion/"&gt;Flood: Farming and Erosion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about farming practices that can reduce flood risk, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.organic/"&gt;Organic Farming: Conserving Top Soil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about other land management practices that can increase the risk of flooding, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.neworleans/"&gt;Hurricanes: New Orleans Under Threat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.missdelta/"&gt;The Mississippi River Delta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construct a model of a river system with levees in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2307_flood.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, scientists investigate how farming along the Mississippi River impacts floods and what can be done about it.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Farmers and rivers have a close, though not always friendly, relationship with one another. Rivers can create prized farmland, but they also flood fields and the communities built alongside them. What's more, farming practices may contribute to an increase in the magnitude and intensity of river flooding. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; explains the flooding problem and suggests possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The Mississippi River watershed drains more than one-third of the United States; rain falling in eastern Montana may eventually end up in the Gulf of Mexico. Such an expansive watershed accommodates a huge volume of water. On average, the Mississippi carries 173,600 cubic meters (227,000 cubic yards) of water per second. On occasion, however, this great river overflows its banks and inundates a wide swath of land on either side known as the floodplain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flooding is a natural part of the life of a river. Before humans intervened, the Mississippi River flooded every year. In fact, floods and the sediments they deliver are largely responsible for the richness of the soil found in floodplains. Unfortunately, these soils and other resources provided by the river have also encouraged people to build communities in the paths of floodwaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, the most common solution to the problem of rivers overflowing their banks -- and damaging property and endangering lives -- has been to artificially increase the height of riverbanks. The Army Corps of Engineers, which has been in charge of flood control in the United States since 1928, boasts a 13,700-kilometer (8,500-mile) system of heightened riverbanks, or levees, along the country's most flood-prone rivers. In addition, the federal government has built flood-control dams on most major streams and rivers in the Mississippi River watershed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This engineering solution arose following a major flood of the lower Mississippi River in 1927. The event flooded 14,000 square miles (37,000 square kilometers) and forced 700,000 people from their homes. Unfortunately, floods have continued to breach levees since 1928, and many people think that simply building higher, stronger walls is no solution to a recurring problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many experts suggest that natural solutions can help to minimize the devastation from floods. They advocate restricting the development of communities in floodplains to keep people and property out of harm's way. They recommend farming practices that help reduce the erosion of topsoil, and in turn the amount of runoff. These include constructing terraces where necessary to reduce the slope of fields, planting non-cash crops between crop rows to better retain moisture and protect topsoil, and plowing circular bands along the contours of fields to slow the flow of water off of them. Lastly, they advocate the conservation of remaining wetlands and the restoration of those that have been damaged or drained. These areas naturally absorb huge volumes of runoff caused by large storms and keep them from entering the river channel where they can cause harm downstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn how farming practices and an anomalous weather pattern caused one of the costliest disasters in U.S. history, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.flood/"&gt;The Great Flood of 1993&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about farming practices that can reduce flood risk, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.organic/"&gt;Organic Farming: Conserving Top Soil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about other land management practices that can increase the risk of flooding, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.neworleans/"&gt;Hurricanes: New Orleans Under Threat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.katrinawet/"&gt;Hurricane Katrina: Wetland Destruction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This brief video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; uses illustrations and the well-preserved footprints of a small reptile to portray the history of the Grand Canyon's top two rock layers.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;As you look at the sedimentary rocks at the Grand Canyon's rim, the top layers of visible rock are the youngest. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, a scientist explains what we know about the changing conditions in this location and the kinds of life they supported. The canyon's top layer, the Kaibab formation, records deposits laid down at the bottom of a shallow sea. The Coconino sandstone formation below it indicates that these watery conditions were preceded by much drier ones.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;All of Earth's rock types fall into one of three categories: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary. Most of the Grand Canyon's exposed rocks belong to the third category: sedimentary rock. When mineral grains are eroded from surface materials, transported by water or wind, and eventually laid down on the ground or seafloor, a loose deposit of sediments forms. Over time, the mounting pressure and heat from subsequent layers compact these soft sediments. Squeezed of their water, the sediment grains are cemented together, or lithified, to form solid -- though brittle -- rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The telltale feature of sedimentary rocks is horizontal bedding, or layering, that ranges in thickness from several millimeters to several meters. As a rule, deeper layers are older than those above them. Because sediments form from different minerals and may be deposited on land or in water, there are many kinds of sedimentary rocks. Sand becomes sandstone, mud becomes shale, and the calcified remains of marine organisms become limestone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fossils, the preserved body parts or impressions left by once-living organisms, can be found in sedimentary rocks. Though discoveries of bones and even whole bodies entombed in ice, tar, or amber may be more celebrated, far more common in the fossil record are trace fossils -- burrows, footprints, and other impressions left by everything from plants to dinosaurs in soft, sandy, or muddy sediments. When these traces are quickly filled in by younger sediment and later lithified, they can be protected from destruction and preserved until they resurface through uplift, erosion, and weathering of ancient sedimentary strata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By studying fossils, scientists learn a great deal about life forms that once inhabited Earth. From its fossilized skeleton and impression, researchers can often discern how an organism looked, moved, and obtained food. By studying the rock layer in which the fossil was found, they can also understand the climate in which the organism lived, and even the circumstances by which it died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about another location where fossil evidence shows that a shallow, inland sea once covered Earth's surface, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.bordensea/"&gt;Fossils: An Ancient Sea in Indiana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about what different types of fossils can teach us about past life forms and the conditions in which they lived, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.fossilcollage/"&gt;Fossils&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how fossils form, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.becfossil/"&gt;Becoming a Fossil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider the light sandstone of the Coconino Formation. What do the composition of the rock and the fossil evidence within it tell us about the environment in which the rock formed? Explain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;List some characteristics of an animal that scientists can determine just from its tracks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What kinds of clues do scientists use to recreate the history of Earth?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This media-rich essay from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; describes the challenges of forecasting volcanic eruptions and includes information about specific cases.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Until recently, people living in a volcano's shadow had little help anticipating an eruption. A major volcanic event might strike with no warning at all. In the past 300 years, volcanic eruptions, most of them unexpected, have killed more than 250,000 people. In 2000, experts estimated that 500 million people were living in areas at risk from catastrophic volcanic eruptions. This media-rich essay from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; describes the strides scientists have made in eruption forecasting in recent years and explores why accurately predicting volcanic events remains difficult.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The majority of volcanoes occur along the boundaries of tectonic plates. At these violent places, slabs of solid rock 5 to 100 kilometers (3 to 62 miles) thick are created and destroyed. Subduction zones, where oceanic crust is forced back into Earth's molten mantle, give rise to 80 percent of the world's volcanoes. The circum-Pacific belt, or Ring of Fire, which stretches up the western coasts of South and North America, across the Aleutian Islands, and down the eastern coasts of Asia, is one such zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Areas where two plates move away from each other, called rift zones, also give rise to volcanic activity. The East African Rift is a wide crack in Earth's crust that runs for more than 1,930 kilometers (1,200 miles) from Malawi through Tanzania, Kenya, and Ethiopia to the Gulf of Aden. Along this rift is a string of active volcanoes that includes Nyiragongo, a so-called stratovolcano located just north of the city of Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Nyiragongo is one of the world's most active and dangerous volcanoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to forecast volcanic eruptions, vulcanologists monitor three types of activity within and around volcanoes: seismic activity, ground deformation, and gas emission. To measure seismic activity within a volcano, scientists use a seismograph &lt;em&gt;--&lt;/em&gt; the same apparatus used to measure earthquakes &lt;em&gt;--&lt;/em&gt; to record vibrations of Earth's crust. When rocks crack or slip past each other or when magma applies pressure to the inside of a volcano's magma channel, the surrounding rock vibrates much the way a tuning fork vibrates when it is struck. Seismographs record both the intensity and the frequency of the vibration, providing information that helps scientists determine the location, amount, and type of activity within a volcano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deformation of the ground on a volcano's slopes and gases emitted from a volcano's vents provide external signs of activity within the volcano. Pressure building inside a volcano's magma chamber or lava tubes may cause the ground surface to bulge outward. Satellite images and sensitive instruments positioned on a volcano's slopes allow scientists to measure elevation changes of a few centimeters or less. Analysis of the composition of gases emitted from a volcano also helps scientists determine the composition of magma inside, an indication of the volcano's explosiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no two volcanoes are alike. A combination that causes one volcano to erupt violently may cause no such result with another volcano. Having a limited number of cases to study, scientists are only beginning to understand the reasons for these variations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Nyiragongo, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.nyiragongo/"&gt;Anatomy of a Volcano&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about one of the largest and deadliest volcanic eruptions in recent history, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.pinatubo/"&gt;Mount Pinatubo: Predicting a Volcanic Eruption&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.lahar/"&gt;Mount Pinatubo: The Aftermath of a Volcanic Eruption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about the tools used to predict hurricanes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.hurricane/"&gt;Hurricanes: New Tools for Predicting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; explores the effects of the Glen Canyon Dam on the beaches, wildlife, and vegetation of the Colorado River.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Since its completion in 1963, the Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River has helped meet society's demands for irrigation, electricity, and flood control. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; documents research that tracks the impact of dams like Glen Canyon on their rivers' ecosystems. Without question, dams transform both upstream and downstream environments in ways that both harm and help local ecology. This only increases the complexity of the issues surrounding these massive structures.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Dams are designed as impenetrable barriers -- strong enough to resist the horizontal pressing force of millions, or even trillions, of gallons of water that would otherwise send the structure sliding down a river valley. Because dams restrict the flow of water downstream, they create artificial lakes upstream. Water released from these reservoirs can be used to generate electricity. Hydroelectric dams like the Glen Canyon Dam along the Colorado River supply almost one-fifth of the world's electricity by using plentiful, renewable river water to spin turbines that power generators. By smoothing out the natural, seasonal variation in water flow, these dams also provide a reliable water supply to regional populations, help reduce the risk of floods and droughts, and provide recreational opportunities, particularly in their upstream reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By many measures, life in the desert southwest has been improved by the damming of the Colorado River. But the presence of the dam and the regulation of water flow have greatly reduced the amount of sediment in the river and the annual variation in water temperature. The large volumes of water from periodic releases tear away at the downstream beaches. The beaches erode more and more because there are no springtime floods to replenish the sands. Some native fish species are unable to adapt to the unusually cold water released by the dam, or to pass the huge blockades to return to upstream spawning grounds. Upstream, entire canyon ecosystems are destroyed under the reservoir as the canyon is filled with sediment and water. Also, the build-up of sediment in the reservoir eventually reduces the electricity-generating capacity of the dam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assessing the value of dams today is a complex matter. Studies designed to look closely at the effects of damming have considered the question of whether opening dams to allow more frequent controlled flooding could rejuvenate a river's ecosystem. Following a federally mandated environmental impact study completed in 1995, and with some public input, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior signed a Record of Decision that established a program to monitor and analyze the effects of dam operations on downstream resources in the Grand Canyon and to recommend adjustments intended to preserve and enhance conditions. Since that time, several hydroelectric dams across the country have been decommissioned and dismantled, restoring natural river flows, but it is still too early to gauge the long-term implications for their respective ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the physics, engineering, and social aspects of dams, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.bbhooverdam/"&gt;Hoover Dam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.bbdamchal/"&gt;The Dam Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how rivers can be used to produce electricity, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.hooverelec/"&gt;Hoover Dam and Hydroelectric Power&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this interactive quiz from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, take the Environmental Challenge and test your knowledge of human impact on the world's natural resources and climate.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;All of Earth's living things depend on healthy, life-sustaining ecosystems for their survival. But continued human population growth, combined with the planet's limited supply of natural resources, might generate disastrous consequences for our shared environment. This interactive quiz from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; tests users' knowledge of humanity's present-day consumption behavior and living conditions. Annotated answers identify trends in both prosperous and less-prosperous nations.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Given enough inhabitants, any kind of organism can jeopardize the health of its ecosystem. The increasing pressure humans are placing on Earth is largely attributable to population growth. Farmable land, fresh water, energy, and transportation are in constant demand by all nations. Yet topsoil erosion, falling water tables, global warming, and air pollution are some of the many symptoms that suggest our planet's natural resources are overstressed by consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1900, world population has quadrupled from 1.5 billion to more than 6 billion people. The average number of children born to each woman has fallen since the 1960s, when global population reached its all-time peak growth rate of about 2 percent per year. Population growth in poorer, developing countries, however, continues to outpace growth in wealthier, developed countries. With more people in younger age groups, population growth in developing countries is expected to accelerate as today's children reach childbearing age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Population growth alone does not tell the entire story. Humanity as a whole already uses more resources than nature can continually regenerate. Although the ecologically productive land available to each person on Earth is 1.7 hectares (4.2 acres), humanity's average "ecological footprint" measures 2.3 hectares (5.9 acres) -- some 35 percent greater than the available space. Developed nations consume more than their share of resources. As poorer nations attain prosperity and increase their use of resources, the picture becomes even bleaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ecosystem that has been taxed of its resources or over-polluted loses its resilience. The maximum number of organisms that a given habitat's resources can support indefinitely is called its carrying capacity. Recent estimates of Earth's carrying capacity for humans range from one or two billion people living in prosperity to 33 billion people on minimum allowances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although advanced technologies like alternative energy sources or bioengineering may help solve some of society's present-day problems, many scientists, economists, and environmentalists are questioning whether the more populous developing countries like India and China should model Western industrial development as the means to improve their overall standard of living. They fear that by doing so, the increased consumption of natural resources and production of waste will stress the environment beyond its limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how recycling can reduce the demand for certain natural resources, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.recycleplant/"&gt;Visiting a Recycling Plant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about conservation and how individuals can take steps to reduce water and energy usage, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.conserve/"&gt;Conserving Water at Home&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.showermath/"&gt;Shower Estimation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about the effects pollution can have on a river system, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.rhine/"&gt;Pollution Along the Rhine River&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most environmental damage is caused by high consumption patterns. What does that mean? How does the amount of consumption in the United States compare to the amount in other countries?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What role does population growth play in resource depletion?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If freshwater is replenished by the water cycle, why are we worried about water scarcity?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a graph that shows the following patterns of change over time: (a) pollution levels rise steadily, (b) pollution levels initially rise, then peak and decline, (c) pollution levels rise slowly, then increase dramatically. Which one of these patterns did Simon Kuznets find applies to nations as they industrialize? What is his explanation for the pattern?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; uses animation to show the relationship between the movement of a tectonic plate and whether volcanoes on the Hawaiian Islands are active or dormant.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Given that all of the Hawaiian Islands were created by volcanic activity, it is somewhat surprising that only one of the islands possesses any active volcanoes. Why did the volcanoes that built the other islands stop erupting and why are those on the big island still active? This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes the role of a relatively rare phenomenon, known as a hot spot, in the formation of these majestic islands.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The theory of plate tectonics describes the movement of plates across Earth's surface. A dozen major plates and several smaller ones make up our planet's crust, which includes both the surface of the continents and the sea floor. These plates are in perpetual &amp;mdash; but nearly imperceptible &amp;mdash; motion. Geologic activities that occur at the boundaries where plates meet demonstrate spectacularly the forces involved in these movements. Some of the most breathtaking of these activities are volcanic eruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly all volcanoes occur at or near plate boundaries. At these locations, sections of Earth's crust and upper mantle are squeezed together or ripped apart, either forcing or allowing molten magma to rise to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 80 percent of all volcanic activity occurs at subduction zones, where plates collide and one slab of ocean crust is forced beneath the other slab and into the mantle. Here the crust melts, and the magma that is generated is forced upward through the overlying plate. Another 15 percent of volcanoes occur at divergent boundaries, primarily along mid-ocean ridges on the ocean floor. In these areas, adjacent plates move away from each other, creating a break, or rift, in the crust. As the rift expands, new magma flows in to fill the space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining 5 percent of volcanoes, such as those that created the Hawaiʻian Islands, occur away from plate boundaries as the result of an anomalous and poorly understood phenomenon called a &lt;em&gt;hot spot&lt;/em&gt;. Hot spots are caused by high-temperature plumes of mantle material that rise from great depths to eventually melt through the crust to form volcanoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists aren't certain where inside Earth hot spots originate, or why, but a couple of hypotheses exist. The first suggests that, as with other volcanoes, subducted plates are responsible for the formation of the volcanoes. However, in this scenario, plates are plunged unusually deep into the mantle. Here the material becomes super-heated and extremely buoyant. According to this hypothesis, a plume generated in this manner might reach the surface far from where it was subducted. Another hypothesis suggests that pockets of highly radioactive material exist deep within Earth, near the boundary between the mantle and the core. As a result of the radioactivity, the material becomes extremely hot, rises to the surface, melts through the crust, and forms volcanoes unconnected to a plate boundary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although hot spot plumes don't seem to move laterally, the plates above them do move. Thus, a volcano on the surface is eventually carried away from the hot spot and ceases to be active. Eventually, this results in a trail of progressively older volcanoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about other modes of island building, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.island/"&gt;Build an Island&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about the effects of a hot spot in the interior of a continent, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.yellowstone/"&gt;A Visit to Yellowstone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the age of one of Hawaiʻi's volcanoes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.dateflows/"&gt;Dating Lava Flows on Mauna Loa Volcano, Hawaiʻi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do all islands form in this way? How are the volcanoes on the Hawaiian Islands different from other volcanoes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is magma called when it erupts on to the Earth's surface?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is considered the best explanation for the origin of the magma that forms the Hawaiian Islands, and explains why all other volcanoes in the Hawaiian Island chain (to the northwest) are now extinct or dormant?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mauna Loa and Kilauea are the main volcanoes on the big island of Hawai'i. Which is the largest? Which is the oldest? Where is most of the active extrusion of lava occurring now on the island of Hawaiʻi?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loihi is the youngest of the Hawaiian volcanoes, although it is not yet an island. Where is it located? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; explains why ice sheets move. To find out how fast they move, scientists carve a tunnel through a glacier.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;With more than 29 million cubic kilometers (7 million cubic miles) of ice and snow, the Antarctic Ice Sheet is so massive that its weight depresses the underlying crust by 900 meters (nearly 3,000 feet). New snow that collects on the ice sheet's surface causes the ice beneath it to spread out and move along the slope of the land. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, a team of glaciologists carves into one glacier on the East Sheet to monitor the nature and speed of its movement.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Glaciers form over hundreds of thousands of years atop land in cold climates where snow and ice remain year-round. As snow layers accumulate, their weight forces underlying snowflakes closer together, thereby reducing the air spaces between them. The individual flakes crystallize and combine with other crystals around them to become glacial ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest glaciers, called continental ice sheets, blanket more than 50,000 square kilometers of land in ice and snow thousands of meters deep. Today, continental ice sheets are found only in Greenland and Antarctica. Divided into two unequal parts by a mountain range, the 14-million-square-kilometer Antarctic Ice Sheet alone contains about 70 percent of Earth's fresh water supply. The larger, eastern part rests entirely above sea level and covers Greater Antarctica. Most of the smaller, western part rests on rock at or below sea level and covers nearly the entire island archipelago collectively named Lesser Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more and more snow collects on an ice sheet and turns to ice, it forms a slight dome. The weight of the ice at the top of the dome becomes so great that gravity causes the underlying ice to slowly deform and spread down slope. The rate of movement varies from less than a meter per year near the dome to several hundred meters per year near the edges. Eventually, the ice flows into the sea, forming floating platforms called ice shelves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand both the nature and speed of ice sheet movement, glaciologists look for evidence within the ice sheets themselves. One particularly instructive type of movement, shearing, occurs when adjacent planes slide past one another at different speeds. Evidence of shearing tells scientists that although the ice sheet's entire mass is in constant motion down slope, its upper part moves faster than its lower part. This happens because the base of the ice sheet is actually frozen to the bedrock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show that in Antarctica, both the top and bottom of the West Sheet are moving much faster in places than the East Sheet. This is significant because, if the entire West Sheet were to slide into the sea, it would raise the global sea level by 6 meters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about ice sheet movement, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.icestreams/"&gt;Antarctic Ice Movement: Part II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the important roles that ice plays in moderating global temperature and ocean circulation, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.esglaciers/"&gt;Earth System: Ice and Global Warming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how glacial melting might affect global sea level, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.icemelt/"&gt;Mountain of Ice: If the Ice Melts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.sealevel/"&gt;Antarctic Ice: Sea Level Change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the challenges that scientists face who work in Antarctica, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.dangers/"&gt;Antarctica: A Challenging Work Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>Within Antarctic ice sheets are fast-moving streams of ice. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; hypothesizes about how ice streams are the result of warming at the end of the last ice age.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;For the most part, an ice sheet moves down slope slowly because the ice is in direct contact with underlying bedrock. In some places, however, ice races along much faster than the rest of the sheet. These areas of fast-moving flow, called ice streams, are believed to be caused by a thin, lubricating layer of water and mud between the ice and the land. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, a team of scientists seeks evidence to support their hypothesis that atmospheric warming -- either now or in the past -- may explain why water has formed beneath the ice sheet.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Antarctica's extremely cold and dry climate preserves its immense, domed ice sheet as snow slowly collects atop the glacial ice. Because the weight of the snow and ice at the top of the dome is so great, gravity forces the ice to spread outward down slope. The rate of movement varies from less than a meter per year near the dome to several hundred meters per year near the edges. Eventually, the glacial ice runs into the sea, forming floating platforms called ice shelves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speed with which an ice sheet moves depends on a few variables, including the thickness of the ice and the pitch of the slope on which it lies. Speeds may also vary along different parts of an ice sheet. Ice streams are well-defined areas up to several kilometers wide where rapid ice flow occurs. They typically run from the dome of the sheet out onto the ice shelves and can travel at speeds of up to a kilometer per year, which is roughly 100 times faster than the surrounding ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under normal conditions, an ice sheet is frozen to the bedrock, which significantly slows its movement down slope. Some glaciologists, however, believe that higher temperatures at the base of the ice produce a film of water and mud that separates the ice from the bedrock to form an ice stream. What might be causing this rise in temperature? Possible explanations include the immense pressure of the overlying ice and areas of volcanism under the ice sheet. A third potential heat source is atmospheric warming. Although recent human activities might be to blame, it could also be possible that the increased atmospheric heat following the end of the last ice age has only now penetrated to the base of the thick ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent studies suggest that Antarctic ice is flowing out to sea faster than it accumulates on land. This is especially the case on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, much of which lies on land depressed below sea level. Because ice in direct contact with seawater is subject to faster warming, the extensive ice shelves of the West Sheet, where sea temperature has risen by 4.5&amp;deg;C in the past 50 years, could precipitate the collapse of the entire sheet. The amount of water contained in the West Sheet could raise the global sea level by 6 meters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about ice sheet movement, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.icesheets/"&gt;Antarctic Ice Movement: Part I&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how glacial melting might affect global sea level, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.icemelt/"&gt;Mountain of Ice: If the Ice Melts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.sealevel/"&gt;Antarctic Ice: Sea Level Change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the important roles that ice plays in moderating global temperature and ocean circulation, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.esglaciers/"&gt;Earth System: Ice and Global Warming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the challenges that scientists face who work in Antarctica, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.dangers/"&gt;Antarctica: A Challenging Work Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This interactive resource from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; shows how an atoll is formed from a volcanic island and describes the role coral reefs play in this process.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Earth is anything but a static body spinning in space. What appears on the surface to be solid and unchanging may actually be undergoing significant transformation, driven by powerful underground processes. This interactive resource from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; explains Darwin's theory of how low-lying coral islands called atolls form in tropical seas from once-towering volcanoes.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Islands form in three main ways. Continental islands are created when land is cut off from a continent as melting ice caps raise the sea level and one-time surface connections are flooded. Volcanic islands form when mountains rise from the sea, built by magma forced to the surface through vents called "hot spots" or as a result of plates overriding one another at plate boundaries. Coral islands, a third island type, begin with colonies of marine coral building reefs that can cover hundreds of square miles. When enough water-borne sand and wind-borne dust accumulate on the reef, an island forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atolls are a distinctive kind of coral island whose low-lying reef surrounds a warm lagoon. These formations exist over sunken volcanic islands, primarily in the South Pacific. Charles Darwin is credited with proposing the foundational theory of how atolls, which are really a hybrid of two island types, develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darwin's theory, which geologists today widely accept, states that as a volcano's magma source is depleted, it begins to sink under its own considerable weight. With it goes the fringing reef that formed in the shallow waters around the island. Because reef animals can only survive near the surface of the water, new animals build vertically on top of the limestone skeletons of past generations. Provided their building keeps the top of the reef near sea level, a barrier reef forms offshore. The sinking island eventually disappears completely under water, leaving an atoll composed of low coral islets that ring a shallow lagoon. The living corals' sandy waste fills the lagoon inside the reef, and that which falls seaward buttresses the entire structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atolls can indicate the age of islands within a chain. Islands with prominent, active volcanoes are younger, whereas smaller or submerged formations like atolls are older, having undergone a transformation that may have taken many millions of years. In fact, if scientists were to drill down through the coral reef, they might have to drill several thousand feet before reaching the basalt that composes the volcano. This indicates that the reef has been growing for a very long time indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atolls are just one example of how biological processes &amp;mdash; reef building, in this case &amp;mdash; can modify Earth's surface. Coal and oil deposits (organic matter subjected to intense heat and pressure over time) and stromatolites (fossilized reef-like structures built long ago by photosynthesizing microbes) are some other examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the formation of volcanic islands, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.hawaii/"&gt;Plate Tectonics: The Hawaiian Archipelago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how biological processes can directly and indirectly modify Earth's surface, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.cavebiogeo/"&gt;Cave Formation: Biogeochemical Cycles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about coral reef formation and the condition of some of the world's reefs today, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.coralkid/"&gt;Coral Kid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain what a coral reef is and how it develops.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why does a volcanic island become smaller over time when its volcano is no longer active?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What conditions must exist for an atoll to continue to develop rather than die?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In general, how important do you think biological processes are in modifying Earth's surfaces?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think Charles Darwin might have been interested in the theory of atoll formation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you think a coral reef can develop around a volcanic island while it is still active?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; tells the tragic story of two Japanese seismologists who disagreed about the threat of earthquakes in the early twentieth century. Today, seismologists in California offer residents a probability of risk that an earthquake might occur.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Earthquake prediction has never been an exact science or an easy job. In 1923, the debate between two Japanese seismologists over whether or not a large earthquake was imminent and the citizens of Tokyo should be warned ended in tragedy. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, a contemporary seismologist tells the story of these two pioneers and describes the events of the infamous Kanto Earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Earthquakes can have devastating consequences, especially when they strike highly populated areas. Unfortunately, predicting when, where, and with what magnitude a quake will strike is almost impossible. In 1923, with the science of seismology in its infancy, two Japanese scientists squared off about the probability of an earthquake striking the Tokyo area in the immediate future. Their debate illustrates the quandary seismologists faced then and still face today: whether or not to risk alarming citizens with earthquake predictions that are based on limited information. In this case, choosing not to put Tokyo and Yokohama on alert or to strengthen building codes in the cities had tragic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1923, Akitune Imamura, a seismologist at the University of Tokyo, had been predicting a major earthquake in Tokyo for nearly 20 years. His predictions were based on seismic readings and historical records of earthquake events in the area, both of which suggested that Tokyo was long overdue for a major quake. Imamura's superior at the University, Professor Omori, insisted that there was not enough evidence to sound the alarm that an earthquake in the city was imminent. As a result, when the Great Kanto Earthquake struck Tokyo and Yokohama late in the morning of September 1st, 1923, few citizens were prepared. The 7.1-magnitude quake and the fires that erupted in its wake killed approximately 140,000 people in the two cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all fairness, Imamura's prediction was probably based as much on intuition as it was on scientific evidence. Even in the twenty-first century, seismologists remain unable to predict the timing and locations of earthquakes. Instead, they use a variety of indirect measures to estimate the probability that an earthquake of a particular size will strike an area. First, they look at earthquake history. Earthquake-prone areas typically experience quakes at regular intervals. Depending how long it has been since the last quake, they estimate the probability that a future quake will happen in a given time period. Second, they measure the accumulation of strain in the rocks surrounding a fault relative to the amount of strain released in the last quake. This provides a measure of how much more strain the rocks can withstand before another quake. Seismologists also look for precursor events, such as changes in groundwater levels, uplifting or tilting of the landscape, or small tremors called foreshocks. All of these events increase the probability of an earthquake occurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the instruments scientists use to detect earthquakes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.seismograph/"&gt;Earthquakes: The Seismograph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the effects of earthquakes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.sanfranthreat/"&gt;Earthquakes: San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.thrustfault/"&gt;Earthquakes: Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about interactions between tectonic plates, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.shake/"&gt;Mountain Maker, Earth Shaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.tectonic/"&gt;Tectonic Plates, Earthquakes, and Volcanoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The two Japanese scientists had differing ideas on earthquake predictions. Whose ideas prevailed and why?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scientists are trained to be objective and find the best explanations for the data that they study. They are also human with emotions and prejudices. How is this demonstrated in the story about the two Japanese scientists?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What can you say about the process of science from viewing this video?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the Japanese earthquake, fire caused more death than collapsing buildings. Why?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The video states that San Francisco has "a 67% probability of a large earthquake." Discuss what this means.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes a simple experiment that confirmed the idea that microbes can accelerate the biogeochemical process of cave formation.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;At first glance, Wyoming's Kane Cave exhibits few characteristics of the world's most picturesque caves &amp;mdash; it lacks mineral deposits, including stalactites and stalagmites, which decorate most cave ceilings and floors. Although the cave is not small, it pales in size against more massive ones, like those of New Mexico's Carlsbad Caverns. However, it is not its size that draws scientists to Kane Cave, but another compelling aspect of the cave. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, watch as scientists conduct a simple experiment to determine whether microbes that inhabit the cave could actually be contributing to the cave-formation process. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The carbon cycle is an example of a biogeochemical cycle in which a certain chemical element interacts with both living (bio-) and nonliving (geo-) components of an ecosystem. Whereas the influence of carbon is more frequently associated with atmospheric change &amp;mdash; for example, an accumulation of airborne carbon may lead to global warming &amp;mdash; another cycling element, sulfur, can shape the very ground on which we walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A radical new theory of cave formation suggests an agent other than carbonic acid can create some of the largest solution cave systems in the world. This agent is sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid reacts with rock surfaces on contact, rapidly dissolving calcite, the primary mineral found in limestone. Scientists have discovered that sulfuric acid is responsible for having carved out massive cavities from the limestone rock where New Mexico's world-famous Carlsbad Caverns are located.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kane Cave in northern Wyoming was also formed from sulfuric acid weathering. Sulfuric acid is capable of dissolving vast amounts of limestone minerals &amp;mdash; far more than carbonic acid can &amp;mdash; but it doesn't readily form in nature. It is a by-product of the activity of certain microbes that populate the ground beneath some caves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lower Kane Cave, scientists analyzing microbe populations noted that something interesting, and apparently different from what had occurred when Carlsbad Caverns formed, seemed to be happening. It was true that bacteria outside the cave system were producing hydrogen sulfide gas from sulfur stored in underground deposits. However, bacteria present &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the cave &amp;mdash; in colonies located in springs running through the cave &amp;mdash; were also converting hydrogen sulfide gas to sulfuric acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn whether the bacteria had simply moved into an existing cave, in which case their activity was modifying what was there, or whether the entire cave-formation process was the result of microbial activity, the scientists conducted a simple test. They exposed chips of pure calcite both to acidic water alone and to acidic water with microbes present. They compared the results over time and determined that the bacteria in the cave were in fact hastening the conversion of hydrogen sulfide gas to sulfuric acid. This, in turn, was influencing how quickly the limestone rock dissolved. Thus, the efficiency with which cave formation occurs in the presence of certain bacteria indicates that the bacteria could have carved out Kane Cave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cave microbes prove that living organisms &amp;mdash; as part of the sulfur cycle &amp;mdash; can actually influence the way caves form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how Carlsbad Caverns were formed, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.cavebiogeo/"&gt;Cave Formation: Biogeochemical Cycles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about solution caves, decorative mineral deposits (speleothems), and karst terrain, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.virtmap/"&gt;Virtual Cave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.caveintro/"&gt;Caves and Karst&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about caves that form through processes other than carbonic acid reacting with limestone, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.caveform/"&gt;How Caves Form&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.lavatube/"&gt;Virtual Lava Tube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is a microbe? Describe the link between microbes and sulfuric acid in caves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regarding the connection between bacteria and cave formation, scientists wondered, "Did the bacteria do all this or did this all happen and they just moved in because it was a great spot to live?" Describe the experiment they performed to answer this question.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the results of the experiment scientists performed to find out if microbes influenced cave formation. Do you think their conclusion is justified? Explain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; features footage of the aftermath of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines, including falling ash and mud flows.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 was the largest volcanic eruption in 80 years. The explosive eruption deposited tons of ash on the towns and villages near the volcano's base. Even more devastating than the eruption, however, were the devastating flows of water and debris that resulted when monsoon rains mixed with the accumulated volcanic ash. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; depicts some of the impact of these events on the communities surrounding the volcano.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Mt. Pinatubo's 500-year dormancy ended in early April 1991. For weeks, the volcano sent warning puffs of gas and ash into the air above the island of Luzon in the Philippines. Scientists monitoring the volcano's activity, including the seismic rumblings deep within it, concluded that a powerful eruption was imminent. This prediction prompted the evacuation of 50,000 people who lived on or near the volcano's slopes, a measure that undoubtedly saved thousands of lives. Despite the warning signs and precautions, however, the power Pinatubo unleashed when it exploded on June 15th, 1991, surprised many people. And yet, the eruption itself was only a precursor to the greater devastation still to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinatubo's 1991 eruption stands as the second-most-powerful volcanic event on Earth in more than a century. The blast created immense avalanches of searing hot gas, ash, and rock, called pyroclastic flows, which roared down the volcano's slopes. Approximately 500 people died as a result. In all, the eruption scattered four to seven cubic kilometers (140 to 250 cubic feet) of ash and rock over the surrounding area, burying some locations under 200 meters (650 feet) or more of debris. This massive accumulation of unstable material set the stage for the next phase of destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within hours after Pinatubo's eruption, a typhoon began dumping heavy rains on the area. The rainwater mixed with the loose volcanic material on the volcano's slopes to form a dense, viscous mud with the consistency of wet cement and cause mudflows, called lahars, to race down Pinatubo's slopes. Ever since, during periods of intense rain, more lahars have periodically carried boulders, homes, vehicles, and bridges down the slopes with them, destroying or burying nearly everything in their path. In the first few years after the 1991 eruption, lahars deposited more than three cubic kilometers &amp;mdash; about 300 million dump-truck loads &amp;mdash; of debris on the lowlands surrounding the volcano. Since 1991, lahars have destroyed the homes of 100,000 people, and nearly 15 years later they continue to threaten at least 100,000 more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because lahars continue to flow down Pinatubo's slopes, early warning is critical. Scientists use remote sensing tools to monitor rainfall and ground vibration in the hope that they will be able to warn down-slope communities of an imminent or active lahar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the eruption of Mt.

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, a fossil found among the Grand Canyon's rock layers reveals the existence of a shallow sea that once covered most of western North America.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;The Colorado River in Grand Canyon National Park has cut a vertical path through rock that dates from the Precambrian period (nearly two billion years ago) to the Permian (250 million years ago). As presented in this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, each of the exposed rock layers, or strata, tells the story of another time period. Through careful study of these layers, scientists can describe how the area's climate has changed, how this affected the environment, and how some of the previous inhabitants looked and behaved.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;All of Earth's rock types fall into one of three categories: igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary. Igneous rocks solidify from a hot, molten state. Some, like granite, cool slowly beneath the ground and produce relatively large crystals. Others, like basalt, form above the surface as molten lava rapidly cools. Metamorphic rocks are any rocks that have been transformed by heat and pressure inside Earth. Examples include slate, schist, and gneiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the Grand Canyon's exposed rocks belong to the third category: sedimentary rock. When mineral grains are eroded from surface materials, transported by water or wind, and eventually laid down on the ground or seafloor, a loose deposit of sediments forms. Over time, these soft sediments are compacted by mounting pressure and heat from subsequent overlying layers. Squeezed of their water, the sediment grains are cemented together, or lithified, to form solid -- though brittle -- rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The telltale feature of sedimentary rocks is horizontal bedding, or layering, that ranges in thickness from millimeters to several meters. As a rule, deeper layers are older than those above them because they were deposited first. Because sediments form from different minerals and may be deposited on land or in water, there are many kinds of sedimentary rocks. Sand becomes sandstone, mud becomes shale, and the calcified remains of marine organisms become limestone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists learn a great deal from analyzing the progression of sedimentary layers. For example, successive limestone and shale layers indicate that sediments were first laid down in a marine environment and then in a coastal swamp environment. The presence of limestone layers in the Grand Canyon's strata suggests that shallow tropical seas periodically covered what is today a desert environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can this be? Global sea level rises or falls as glaciers and ice sheets melt or freeze. When tides rise, oceans flood the land. Marine deposits settle to the seafloor and later turn into limestone. When the oceans retreat, muddy or sandy deposits typically form. These lithify into shale or sandstone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advance and retreat of Earth's oceans explains how ancient coral reef formations can be found in the middle of deserts, whale bones can be found in Pakistan, and, as is featured in this video segment, nautiloid impressions can be found in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about a remarkable find -- whale skeletons in the Sahara Desert -- check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.howreally/"&gt;Evolving Ideas: How Does Evolution Really Work?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about how different rock types weather over time, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.erosion/"&gt;Erosion and Weathering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is the Grand Canyon such a valuable site for geologists studying the history of the changing Earth?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where are the oldest rocks in the Grand Canyon found? Why?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What evidence indicates a vast, shallow sea covered the area that includes the Grand Canyon?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How could scientists know the age of the rock layer that contained the fossil nautiloid?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research what other fossils might be found in the Redwall Limestone of the Grand Canyon, which formed about 335 million years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes the emergence of life on the islands of Hawaiʻi from a barren volcanic platform under the ocean waves to the rich explosion of life that covers the many climate zones of the islands today.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;The tip of a new volcanic island appears above the surface of the ocean. Solidified black lava gleams in the sunshine. Although it may not be obvious, the processes that will turn this new piece of land into a tropical paradise have already begun. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; chronicles an island's transformation from a barren lava flow to a rich ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;If you were to explore the ground in almost any terrestrial region on Earth, chances are you would find soil. This layer of Earth's surface is essential to life. It supplies, both directly and indirectly, what we eat and wear, as well as the oxygen we breathe. Even so, it's easy to take soil for granted. You might assume that the soil near your home or elsewhere has been there forever. However, the land surface has changed dramatically over geologic time. For instance, depending on its location, soil formation may have been interrupted by volcanic activity, glacial movement, or climate change. In some parts of the world, entirely new land masses are forming as you read this. So what is soil, how does it form, and how does it support life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soil formation begins with the weathering of rock through chemical and physical processes. When rock, such as that laid down by active volcanoes on the big island of Hawaiʻi, is newly formed, chemical and physical weathering begin almost the moment the lava cools. Rain, wind, and surf break large pieces of rock into smaller pieces, which are then broken into even smaller pieces. Soon, tiny organisms such as bacteria and fungi occupy small crevices in the rocks. Through respiration, photosynthesis, and chemosynthesis (the production of carbohydrates using chemical energy), these organisms produce gases and nutrients that support further soil development. As organisms die, they leave their remains behind. Each death contributes additional organic compounds to the soil. The nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorous, are stored in the soil, where other organisms use them. Eventually these organisms will contribute their own biomass to the accumulation of soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental conditions affect the development of soil properties and characteristics. Climatic variables, especially temperature and precipitation, strongly influence the rate of the weathering of rocks and soil. The kind of soil that forms in a particular location also depends on the physical and chemical properties of the parent rock. Vegetation, as well as soil microorganisms, affects both the rate of soil formation and the composition of the soil. The topography, or the slope, shape, and direction of the land surface, affects how water travels through a landscape and determines the soil's resistance to erosion by water. Lastly, soil properties and characteristics are influenced by the length of time these processes have been in operation. So, when you see raw, unweathered, solidified lava, you are actually seeing the initiation of the soil-formation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how life might have originated on Earth, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.ess.earthsys.deepseavents/"&gt;Deep-Sea Vents and Life's Origins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.cell.stetteroxygen/"&gt;Life Before Oxygen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.lifecondtn/"&gt;Caves: Extreme Conditions for Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about some of the elements scientists think are essential to life, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.water/"&gt;Ingredients for Life: Water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.lifeessential/"&gt;Life's Little Essential: Liquid Water&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.carbon/"&gt;Ingredients for Life: Carbon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explore environmental factors involved in evolution of plant and animal life on Hawaiian volcanic islands in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2211_hawaii.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe how different life forms &amp;mdash; plants, birds, marine organisms &amp;mdash; arose in the Hawaiian Islands. What was the first type of life that developed on the Hawaiian Islands? What are some reasons that snakes, land mammals, and ants are not native to the Hawaiian Islands?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why was it difficult for life to flourish on the islands? Why does it take so long for plants to grow on lava flows?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did soil develop on the Hawaiian Islands? How did lichens, mosses and ferns pave the way for other plants to grow on the Hawaiian Islands?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is the soil that is created over time on the Hawaiian Islands very fertile?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think 90% of Hawaiʻi's species are endemic to the archipelago?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; exposes how decades of development and geography combined to make the potential damage from a hurricane uniquely devastating in New Orleans, Louisiana.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Long before Hurricane Katrina, most experts knew the city of New Orleans was vulnerable. Situated up to 3.7 meters (12 feet) below sea level, between a lake and a river, and on the hurricane-prone Gulf Coast, the city was arguably a disaster waiting to happen. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; describes the threat Hurricane Ivan posed just one year before Katrina &amp;mdash; an ominous foreshadowing of one of the country's worst natural disasters.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Humans have been altering the natural environment to suit their needs for thousands of years. We've constructed shelter where none existed, planted food crops where forests once flourished, and in one of the more striking examples, built an entire city in the middle of a swamp. New Orleans, Louisiana, is a testament to the human will and ingenuity required to overcome seemingly impossible odds &amp;mdash; in a part of the world where a great deal of commerce stood to be gained. However, in August 2005, Hurricane Katrina tragically illustrated the potential consequences of defying the forces of nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Orleans sits in the middle of an ancient floodplain of the Mississippi River. Periodically, this mighty river, like most wild rivers, overflowed its banks, inundating the surrounding area. What was a natural and necessary occurrence for the wetland ecosystem of the Gulf coast threatened the viability of communities along the banks of the Mississippi. In response to this threat, people, as part of a government plan, began building a system of levees to heighten the river's banks and protect themselves from flooding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the centuries-old effort to control seasonal river flooding in New Orleans and other coastal cities has made the same communities increasingly vulnerable to ocean flooding from tropical storms and hurricanes. Wetlands along the Gulf coast provide the first line of defense against deadly hurricanes, by both limiting the storms' access to the warm open ocean water that drives them and by creating a physical barrier to the floodwaters, or storm surges, that they generate. Yet, coastal wetlands have been deteriorating and shrinking for decades because they no longer receive the influx of sediment and nutrients that periodic river flooding once provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom, or substrate, of coastal wetlands is unstable. It settles and sinks continuously. Without a steady supply of new sediment and nutrients, wetland plants soon become flooded themselves, causing expanses of open water to form. As a result of Mississippi River flood control, together with the opening of shipping channels that have caused saltwater to infiltrate freshwater wetlands, Louisiana has lost nearly 5180 square kilometers (2,000 square miles) of coastal wetlands, an area the size of the state of Delaware, in the last 70 years. As this trend continues, the likelihood that another hurricane will devastate the Gulf Coast region only increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn what happened when a Category 4 hurricane struck New Orleans, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.katrinawet/"&gt;Hurricane Katrina: Wetland Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.katrinavid/"&gt;Hurricane Katrina: A Scientist's Response&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.katrinadoc/"&gt;Hurricane Katrina: Possible Causes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about the equipment and methods scientists use to predict hurricanes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.hurricane/"&gt;Hurricanes: New Tools for Predicting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how hurricanes form, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.hurrlife/"&gt;How Hurricanes Form&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.eshurricane/"&gt;Earth System: El Niño's Influence on Hurricane Formation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt;, explore the main features of the Nyiragongo volcano, located in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and learn what risks it poses to the 500,000 people who live in its shadow.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Volcanoes repeatedly remind people of Earth's potential for violence. Since 1700, volcanic eruptions have killed more than 250,000 people and devastated scores of communities. What causes these dramatic geologic displays? This interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; provides a detailed look at the inner workings of one of the world's most dangerous volcanoes, Nyiragongo in the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;What sets volcanoes apart from other mountains is the manner in which they form. Volcanic eruptions are fueled by heat released from magma, a mixture of molten rock, suspended minerals, and dissolved gases. Most rocks melt at temperatures between 800&amp;deg;C and 1,200&amp;deg;C (1472&amp;deg;F and 2192&amp;deg;F). This occurs in the layers of Earth's mantle known as the lithosphere and asthenosphere, at depths of 50 km to 250 km (31 mi to 155 mi) beneath the surface. Because magma is molten, it is less dense than the surrounding rocks. This causes magma to move upward and eventually either come into contact with and intrude into portions of Earth's crust or be released through volcanic vents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volcanic eruptions vary greatly in their intensity. In general, the most explosive eruptions come from magmas that, due to their high silica content, maintain high gas levels as they reach the surface. Silica-rich magmas, including andesite and dacite, are also thicker, or more viscous. The more viscous a substance is, the more it resists flow. Because these magmas do not flow quickly, pressure builds behind them as they move through vents in the volcano. In contrast, magmas that are low in silica, such as basalt, tend to be relatively fluid. They allow gas to easily escape and produce streaming lava flows and typically less volatile eruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists classify volcanoes according to how explosively they erupt, as well as their height and shape. The four types of volcanoes they recognize are cinder cones, lava domes, shield volcanoes, and composite volcanoes. Cinder cones are relatively small, symmetrical, steep-sided volcanoes that form on or near other volcanoes of the same or different types. Their shape and vertical structure result from volcanic material being launched nearly straight up into the air during eruptions and then falling back down and settling near the volcano's peak. Lava domes are also relatively small volcanoes that form on or near other larger volcanoes. What distinguishes lava domes from cinder cones are their rounded, lumpy shapes that result from the very thick, or viscous, magma that feeds them. Shield volcanoes are typically very large, symmetrical volcanoes created by non-explosive eruptions of low viscosity lava flowing long distances to create the volcano's gentle slopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, composite volcanoes (also called stratovolcanoes) such as Nyiragongo, located in the Democratic Republic of Congo, are typically asymmetrical and can erupt explosively. Although most composite volcanoes produce lava of high viscosity, Nyiragongo and others combine explosiveness with low-viscosity, fast-flowing lava. This combination has been deadly in the past and is the reason experts consider this volcano to be one of the most dangerous in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Nyiragongo, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.forecastvol/"&gt;Forecasting Volcanic Eruptions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the risks volcanoes pose, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.volcanerupt/"&gt;Volcanic Eruptions and Hazards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.lahar/"&gt;Mount Pinatubo: The Aftermath of a Volcanic Eruption&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.pinatubo/"&gt;Mount Pinatubo: Predicting a Volcanic Eruption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about volcanoes and how they form, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.hawaii/"&gt;Plate Tectonics: The Hawaiian Archipelago&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.tectonic/"&gt;Tectonic Plates, Earthquakes, and Volcanoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; relates the dramatic story of vulcanologists trying to predict the timing of the cataclysmic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;No two volcanic eruptions happen in exactly the same way. Volcanoes are inherently unpredictable. Even so, scientists have learned to read the many signs volcanoes give off prior to an eruption in the hope of minimizing damage to lives and personal property. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes the race to read the signs presented by Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, just before it unleashed one of the most powerful eruptions of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;For 600 years, Mount Pinatubo appeared to be sleeping. Towering 1745 meters (5725 feet) over the Philippine island of Luzon, the seemingly dormant volcano showed no signs of an impending catastrophic eruption. Then, in early April 1991, Pinatubo stirred, sending puffs of steam into the air. Soon after this first event, vulcanologists began measuring vibrations inside the mountain using seismometers, the same instruments used to measure earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seismometers record vibrations in the Earth. When rocks crack or slip, or when magma applies pressure to the inside of a volcano's magma channel, the surrounding rock vibrates, much like a tuning fork vibrates when it is struck. Seismometers record both the intensity of the vibration, measured by the height of the line on the seismogram, and the frequency, measured by the distance between the peaks and valleys on the graph. Scientists use the information they collect from seismic events to understand volcanic activity inside a volcano and to make predictions about impending eruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By May 1991, seismic data, coupled with increased sulfur dioxide released from the volcano, suggested to scientists that new magma was filling the volcano's magma chambers. Pinatubo's rapidly growing lava dome foretold an imminent large-scale eruption. The combined evidence suggested to the vulcanologists that the volcano's magma chamber held a gas-charged, potentially explosive type of magma called andesite magma. Based on the evidence, all the necessary preconditions appeared to be in place to create a catastrophic eruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the hazard assessment of Pinatubo's threat included field surveys to determine the size and extent of the volcano's previous eruptions. Scientists found volcanic debris from earlier eruptions cast up to 16 kilometers (10 miles) from the volcano. As a result, in early June officials evacuated 50,000 people from within this 16-kilometer (10-mile) perimeter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the volcano erupted on June 15th, the explosion was devastating. Still, thanks to accurate predictions and emergency preparations, only 500 people died, compared to the tens of thousands who might have lost their lives if they hadn't been evacuated in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about how scientists use seismographs to predict volcanic eruptions, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.seismic/"&gt;Seismic Signals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the challenges in predicting volcanic eruptions, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.forecastvol/"&gt;Forecasting Volcanic Eruptions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see the devastation caused by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo and Mount St. Helens, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.lahar/"&gt;Mount Pinatubo: The Aftermath of a Volcanic Eruption&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.helens/"&gt;Mount St. Helens: Before and After&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What questions are scientists trying to answer by lava sampling?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why does scientist Mike Garcia refer to the basalt he is walking on as "the youngest real estate on Earth"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How hot is the lava?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For what scientific reason does Mike Garcia quickly quench the hot lava with water?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What has the study of the composition of the lavas from Kilauea and Mauna Loa revealed about their origins and relationship?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Lava is molten rock (or magma) from Earth's mantle that has reached the surface. Collecting information concerning its temperature and chemical composition, how it behaves as it flows on the surface, and how it moves through its underground chambers and tubes can help volcano researchers better gauge the timing and nature of future eruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By taking a sample from within the volcano (as through a "skylight"), researchers can study the lava's chemical and physical properties. What they learn can help them unravel not only the path magma takes to the surface, but how it exists deep within Earth's interior. When it is exposed to air and cools, lava becomes more viscous and ultimately crystallizes. As crystallization proceeds, the chemical composition of the lava changes, and the original chemical components and their respective proportions in the sample become difficult to identify. By quenching a sample with water, crystals have little time to form, and any chemical change is minimized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like fingerprints vary from one person to another, the chemical components and proportions in lavas vary from one volcano to another. By comparing data from different samples, researchers can determine whether or not they come from the same volcano. Researchers can also establish whether or not different volcanoes share a common magma source. Through such analyses, each of the great Hawaiian volcanoes is now believed to have its own underground network. If they were interconnected, as a household heating system is, activity at one volcano would cause a reaction at another to maintain equilibrium within the system, and lavas erupted from different volcanoes would have nearly the same composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lava sampling is just one of several methods scientists use to learn about volcanoes. Because gas content varies depending on the nature of the material that melted to form the magma, analyzing trapped vent gases can help forecast the type and timing of eruptions. Generally speaking, the most explosive eruptions come from magmas that, due to their high silica content, are thick and viscous and maintain high gas levels as they reach the surface. By contrast, silica-poor magmas produce streaming lava flows and less volatile eruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about hazards associated with lava and other volcanic emissions, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.volcanerupt/"&gt;Volcanic Eruptions and Hazards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about volcanoes and how they form, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.volcanintro/"&gt;Volcanism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.hawaii/"&gt;Plate Tectonics: The Hawaiian Archipelago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, scientist Mike Garcia draws lava samples at the foot of the active Kilauea volcano to see if it is related to its neighboring volcano, Mauna Loa.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, watch as scientists collaborate to collect and then chemically analyze samples of molten lava as part of their quest to learn more about how volcanoes work. By collecting samples of lava before it has a chance to cool, researchers can study the chemical properties it had when it was deep within Earth's interior, just before it was forced to the surface. Questions such as whether two volcanoes share a common magma source can be answered through such analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>

      <annotation>The history of earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay area is plotted on a digital map and analyzed in this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;The prediction of earthquakes may be inexact, but it is vital, especially when large cities such as San Francisco or Los Angeles are threatened. The San Andreas Fault and two other lesser-known faults all have the potential to deliver a massive earthquake to the San Francisco Bay area. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, a seismologist interprets earthquake data and explains how these data are used to predict the location and timing of San Francisco's next big earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Earthquake detection has come a long way since the 1906 earthquake hit San Francisco. Improved seismographs pick up vibrations anywhere in the world and enable scientists to identify the location and magnitude of the smallest tremor. Nevertheless, earthquake prediction remains a very inexact science. Data are scarce and difficult to interpret. Often, by the time scientists are able to predict an earthquake, it has already happened. Yet, seismologists continue to try to predict earthquakes. However, rather than trying to predict the exact timing and location of a tremor, they estimate the probability that an earthquake will strike a particular area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seismologists base their probability estimates on several indirect indicators. First, they look at earthquake history. Earthquake-prone areas typically experience seismic activity at regular intervals. Based on how long it has been since the last earthquake, scientists estimate the probability that a future tremor will occur within a given time period. Second, they measure the accumulation of strain in the rocks surrounding a fault relative to the amount of strain released in the most recent earthquake. This provides a measure of how much more strain the rocks can withstand before they fracture again. Seismologists also look for precursor events, such as changes in groundwater levels, uplifting or tilting of the landscape, or small tremors called foreshocks. Any of these events increases the probability that an earthquake will occur in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because earthquakes are inherently unpredictable, governments in earthquake-prone areas have sought to limit damage and loss of life by strengthening building codes. Collapsed buildings are responsible for many earthquake-related deaths. Not surprisingly, the damage produced by an earthquake is directly related to the strength or quality of the structures involved. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude earthquake in southeastern Iran damaged or destroyed 85 percent of the buildings in the city of Bam. Forty thousand people died and 30,000 were injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, at least in developed countries, structures are built to withstand the vibrations caused by earthquakes. Builders often use materials that bend somewhat under stress, so that they sway slightly when an earthquake strikes, instead of crumbling. Many building codes call for buildings to have solid foundations attached to bedrock, which provides strength at a structure's base, even if the soil around it becomes unstable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the instruments scientists use to detect earthquakes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.seismograph/"&gt;Earthquakes: The Seismograph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the effects of earthquakes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.japan/"&gt;Earthquake Prediction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.thrustfault/"&gt;Earthquakes: Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about interactions between tectonic plates, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.shake/"&gt;Mountain Maker, Earth Shaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.tectonic/"&gt;Tectonic Plates, Earthquakes, and Volcanoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt;, you can see the four primary types of earthquakes produced by volcanoes and the signals each produces on a seismometer.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Not so long ago, people living near volcanoes had little that might help them to anticipate an eruption. A deep rumble, a puff of smoke, and ash might foreshadow a major volcanic event. Or a volcano might erupt with no warning at all. This interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; illustrates some of the clues modern seismologists are using to better understand activity deep within a volcano, in hopes of improving their ability to predict eruptions.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The majority of earthquakes and volcanoes occur along the boundaries of tectonic plates. At these boundaries, slabs of oceanic or continental crust collide, slide alongside each other, or are torn apart. Their movement is driven by convection currents in molten material in Earth's mantle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plate boundaries are violent places. Slabs of solid rock that may be more than 30 kilometers (98 ft) thick are created or destroyed. Subduction zones, where oceanic crust is forced back into Earth's molten mantle, give rise to 80 percent of the world's earthquakes and volcanoes. The Circum-Pacific Belt or Ring of Fire, which stretches up the western coasts of South and North America, across the Aleutian Islands, and down the eastern coasts of Asia, is one such zone. The Mediterranean Belt, which divides Africa and Europe, is a smaller boundary zone, but it is extremely active, especially with respect to earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earthquakes and volcanoes often occur independently of one another. In some cases, however, as this interactive activity describes, earthquake activity may foreshadow volcanic eruptions. Over the past decade or so, scientists have begun to read the seismic vibrations within volcanoes to try to better predict the timing and intensity of eruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure earthquakes generated by volcanoes, scientists use a seismometer -- the same apparatus used to measure other types of earthquakes -- which records vibrations of Earth's crust. When rocks crack or slip past each other, or when magma applies pressure to the inside of a volcano's magma channel, the surrounding rock vibrates much the way a tuning fork vibrates when it is struck. Seismometers record both the intensity of the vibration, measured by the height of the line on the seismogram, as well as the vibration's frequency, measured by the distance between the peaks or valleys on the graph. Scientists use the information they collect from seismic events to gain a better understanding of volcanic activity inside a volcano, and if and when it might erupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the internal structure of volcanoes and how they erupt, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.nyiragongo/"&gt;Anatomy of a Volcano&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.volcanfeatr/"&gt;Volcanic Features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the instruments scientists use to detect earthquakes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.seismograph/"&gt;Earthquakes: The Seismograph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; uses historical illustrations, photographs, and animations to explain how seismographs work, the difference between P and S waves, and the Richter scale.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In 1755, when a deadly earthquake struck the city of Lisbon, no one understood what could cause the ground to shake as it did. Observations of residents indicated that the quake had delivered two distinct types of vibrations. Since that time, scientists have developed and used a device called a seismometer to better understand seismic waves. Today, seismometers help scientists predict earthquakes. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes the history of seismology.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Earth's tectonic plates are in constant motion and, because the plates are not all moving in the same direction, the boundaries where they meet are often violent places. Boundaries where two plates move away from each other, usually found on the ocean floor, give rise to spectacular undersea volcanoes. In places where plates collide, huge slabs of crust buckle to create mountains, or one slides above and the other below to trigger violent volcanic eruptions on Earth's surface. Along other boundaries, plates slide haltingly past each other, causing earthquakes as they bind and then suddenly break loose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving tectonic plates produce unfathomable force. Wherever this force exceeds the strength of the rock that makes up the plate, the rock will fracture and shift. The area where these fractures occur is called a fault. Plate movement pushes rocks on either side of a fault to move past each other, albeit slowly. Most of the time, friction keeps the rocks from moving, and the fault is said to be "locked." When the fault is locked, stress in the rocks increases until the rocks fracture and slip into new positions. This causes energy to be released in the form of vibrations, called seismic waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seismic waves travel in all directions away from the point where a fracture occurs. This point, called the focus, is usually several kilometers below the surface. The location at the surface directly above the focus is the earthquake's epicenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earthquakes generate three prominent types of seismic waves. The first two, called primary waves and secondary waves, or P and S waves, are detailed in this video segment. P waves cause rock particles to be compressed and decompressed in the same direction the wave is traveling. S waves cause rock particles to move at right angles, i.e., up and down or side to side, relative to the direction the wave is traveling. The third type, called surface waves, travels slowly over Earth's surface in a motion similar to ocean waves. These are the slowest moving of the three waves, but they are also the most damaging because they cause the surface and anything on it, including people, buildings, and water, to rise and fall dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists use instruments called seismometers to measure seismic waves. Using these tools, they can determine both the magnitude of the vibration &amp;mdash; by the height of the line on the seismogram &amp;mdash; and the vibration's frequency &amp;mdash; by the distance between the peaks or valleys on the graph. Depending on its configuration, a seismometer can record either vertical or horizontal motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the effects of earthquakes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.japan/"&gt;Earthquake Prediction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.sanfranthreat/"&gt;Earthquakes: San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.thrustfault/"&gt;Earthquakes: Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about interactions between tectonic plates, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.shake/"&gt;Mountain Maker, Earth Shaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.tectonic/"&gt;Tectonic Plates, Earthquakes, and Volcanoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about how scientists use seismographs to predict volcanic eruptions, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.seismic/"&gt;Seismic Signals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the differences between P and S waves. Why do you think these different kinds of waves have different effects? Describe the effects of each.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replay the section on the Lisbon earthquake. Describe when the P waves hit and what happened. Do the same for S waves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss how the Lisbon earthquake informed our understanding of earthquakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does a seismograph record an earthquake's waves?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the Richter scale, how much stronger is a 7 than a 6? How much stronger is an 8 than a 6?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, animations are used to show how the hills around Los Angeles were formed by earthquakes at small thrust faults that extend outward from the larger San Andreas fault.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Even if you have never been to California, you have probably heard of the San Andreas Fault. Although it is the longest and one of the most active fault zones in California, the San Andreas is not responsible for every earthquake in the state. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes another type of fault and explains why it may present a greater danger to the city of Los Angeles than the San Andreas Fault.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The majority of earthquakes and volcanoes occur along the boundaries of tectonic plates, where slabs of solid rock up to 30 kilometers (19 miles) thick are pulled apart, slide past one another, or collide with other slabs. The Pacific Ring of Fire, so called for the prevalence of volcanic and seismic activity in the area, is a series of such boundaries. There, the Pacific Plate comes in contact with other plates along the west coasts of North and South America, across the Aleutian Islands, and down the east coasts of Asia and Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plate boundaries are defined by the direction plates move in relation to one another. At divergent boundaries, plates move away from each other; at convergent boundaries, they move toward each other; and at transform boundaries, they slide past each other. All three types of movement apply stress and strain to the rocks that make up the plates. When the strain becomes too intense, rocks fracture and shift, resulting in a separation, or fault, as well as the telltale vibrations of earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where the Pacific and North American plates meet along the west coast of North America, both transform and convergent boundaries can be found. Transform boundaries produce strike-slip faults, such as the infamous San Andreas Fault. Along the 1,300 kilometers (800-miles) of the San Andreas, the two plates roughly slide past each other in opposite directions. When the plates become temporarily locked, forces that drive plate motion cause stress and strain to build up in rocks that make up the plates. When this strain exceeds the strength of the rocks involved, the rocks fracture along faults, temporarily relieving the strain and causing the vibrations we feel as earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of greater concern for the city of Los Angeles are thrust faults, which sometimes occur at convergent boundaries. At these faults, which extend directly under the city, rocks can give way to immense pressure causing one slab to move over the top of the other. The lower plate then pushes the other plate upward. Within the last ten years, geologists have discovered that this upward thrusting can sometimes happen very quickly, increasing the height of mountains several feet in a single event. While earthquakes generated by this type of fault might lack the intensity of those associated with the San Andreas Fault, they carry greater potential for catastrophe in Los Angeles because they originate directly beneath the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the effects of earthquakes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.japan/"&gt;Earthquake Prediction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.sanfranthreat/"&gt;Earthquakes: San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about interactions between tectonic plates, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.shake/"&gt;Mountain Maker, Earth Shaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.tectonic/"&gt;Tectonic Plates, Earthquakes, and Volcanoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the instruments scientists use to detect earthquakes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.seismograph/"&gt;Earthquakes: The Seismograph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design and build an earthquake-proof house of cards in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2116_killerqu.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the plate motion of the Pacific Plate and the North American plate throughout California. Is it a smooth boundary? Explain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In how many years do scientists expect Los Angeles to be across from San Francisco?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does a thrust fault compare with the San Andreas fault? Discuss the different causes of these two kinds of faults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why are there so many small, fractured thrust faults near Los Angeles? What are the implications for the city?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the statement: "We'd look like Kansas if we didn't have our faults and our earthquakes."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Geologic features altered by earthquakes provide striking evidence of the power of seismic events. It wasn't until the late 1970s, though, that their usefulness in helping to predict the timing of future earthquakes was considered. That's when geologist Kerry Sieh thought to use fractures in layers of sediment to determine the frequency of earthquake events. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; explores the method Dr. Sieh used to revolutionize earthquake prediction.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;People have known for centuries that some regions of the world are more prone to earthquakes than others. In some locations, large earthquakes occur frequently enough for residents to experience several in a lifetime, and many are recorded in local histories. Seismic events also create their own historical record through the fractures, or faults, that they generate along Earth's surface. These faults provide physical evidence of where earthquakes occurred in the past and indicate where they are likely to occur in the future. Until recently, scientists thought this evidence said little about &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; a future earthquake might occur. However, that changed in the late 1970s when a geologist began exploring a dry creek bed whose path had been diverted by successive earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earthquakes result from the movement of tectonic plates. At one type of plate boundary, called a transform boundary, plates slide roughly past each other in opposite directions. When the plates become temporarily locked along these boundaries, forces that drive plate motion cause stress and strain to build up in rocks that make up the plates. When this strain exceeds the strength of the rocks involved, the rocks fracture along faults, temporarily relieving the strain and causing the vibrations we feel as earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most active faults in the world is California's San Andreas Fault. More than 1,000 earthquakes occur along this 1,300-kilometer-long (800-mile-long) fault system that forms part of the transform boundary between the Pacific and North American plates. Most of these quakes are too small to be felt. Others, such as those that occurred along the San Andreas in 1857 and 1906, shake the earth violently. The 1906 earthquake and resulting fires killed hundreds and all but destroyed San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large earthquakes such as these cause significant shifts in the position of plates along a fault. During the 1857 and 1906 earthquakes, the Pacific and North American plates shifted by as much as six meters (20 feet) in opposite directions. These shifts accumulate over time and are recorded as separate breaks in layers of sediment. By dating organic material laid down in the sediment, geologists can determine when earthquakes have occurred, how frequently, and the amount of plate movement that resulted from each event. From such evidence, geologists have determined that large earthquakes have occurred on the San Andreas Fault approximately every 132 years for the past 2,000 years or so. These findings suggest that the probability of a large earthquake striking this area in the next 50 years is high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the effects of earthquakes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.japan/"&gt;Earthquake Prediction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.sanfranthreat/"&gt;Earthquakes: San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.thrustfault/"&gt;Earthquakes: Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about interactions between tectonic plates, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.shake/"&gt;Mountain Maker, Earth Shaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.tectonic/"&gt;Tectonic Plates, Earthquakes, and Volcanoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why has the geologist searched for evidence of past earthquakes along this section of the San Andreas Fault?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think of a way (or a model) to demonstrate the build-up of strain on a fault, and how an earthquake will suddenly release that strain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the types of prehistoric evidence that geologists have used to understand earthquakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Name and discuss all the different methods you saw that the geologists used in this video.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you think geologists will ever find a way to accurately predict when a big earthquake will occur?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; features the twisted and melted forms of the Grand Canyon's oldest rocks, the 1.7-billion-year-old Vishnu Schist.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; features the twisted and melted forms of the Grand Canyon's oldest rocks, the Vishnu Schist. These rocks, exposed only in the deepest part of the canyon, are the remains of mountains that may have rivaled the mighty Himalayas in height. The segment explains why metamorphic formations like these are so resistant to erosive forces.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The Colorado River has flowed through the Grand Canyon for about five million years, and it continues today to slowly cut its channel deeper into the rock. In the deepest part of the canyon, the water flows past its oldest rock, known to geologists as the Vishnu Schist. This dark metamorphic layer is 1.7 billion years old and all that remains of a mountain range that scientists estimate had peaks as tall as the Rocky Mountains or the Himalayas, if not taller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metamorphic rock forms from any type of parent rock whose texture and chemical makeup is changed due to intense pressure and heat. The pressure comes either from the weight of overlying rock or from compressive forces generated when rocks are deformed during mountain-building episodes. These forces cause the temperature of the rock to verge on its melting point, so that the solid rock "bakes" into another form. Because the size, spacing, and shape of the parent rock all change under heat and pressure, metamorphic rock is extremely hard and resists erosion better than other rock types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mountains are built by tectonic processes that cause portions of Earth's crust to rise or collide. These processes are fueled by heat escaping from Earth's interior. Mountain ranges have large roots that counter the enormous mass of the range above Earth's surface. As erosive processes such as wind and water wear down mountain ranges, their roots are buoyed upward by the underlying mantle. Gradually, rocks from deeper and deeper levels inside Earth rise to the surface and are worn away. Over about 450 million years, the range that overlay the Vishnu Schist eroded into the sea to form a level plain. As climatic conditions changed and coastlines advanced and retreated over the area, new rock layers were laid down upon the roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though they may seem like permanent features, mountains do not last forever. Most major mountain ranges both present and past began as sediments -- the by-products of erosion of even older mountain ranges. This is part of the rock cycle in which rocks are uplifted, distorted, and folded, and eventually leveled again by erosion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about the Grand Canyon's oldest rocks, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.anvil/"&gt;The Grand Canyon: Its Youngest Rocks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about what happens to rock as it moves through the rock cycle, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.rockcycle/"&gt;Rock Cycle Animation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which of the three major rock types is the 1.7-billion-year-old Vishnu Schist, described in the video as once "sandstone and shale, which have been cooked..."?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The video states there once was a mountain range as high as the Himalayas before the Vishnu Schist was formed. What evidence has led geologists to reach this conclusion?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you predict will happen in the Grand Canyon in the future?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; features a variety of scientific perspectives on the age old question, "Are we alone in the universe?" Animations make vivid the improbability that we could intercept a radio wave signaling extra terrestrial intelligence.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;As far as we know, only one planet has life on it &amp;mdash; Earth. But is it really possible that our planet is the only life-bearing planet in the entire universe? Some scientists believe that extraterrestrial life does exist, and some even believe that there may be advanced alien life. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn about the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;In the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), researchers differentiate between advanced and non-advanced civilizations. An advanced civilization is defined as one with the ability to conduct interstellar communication &amp;mdash; to send electromagnetic signals through space. Using this definition, human civilization only became advanced within the past century, when local communication such as radio and television broadcasts began to be transmitted to interstellar space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SETI researchers are looking for broadcast signals that could only be produced by intelligent alien civilizations. Because our technology is not advanced enough to pick up weak signals, a strong, deliberate beacon created by extraterrestrials with the purpose of getting our attention is our best hope for finding intelligent alien life. Using some of the largest telescopes in the world, researchers look in the radio and optical bands of the electromagnetic spectrum for unusual signals, such as pulses, that have characteristics that are unlikely to be produced by nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first modern SETI search was conducted in 1960 and led to many more projects. However, federal funding for SETI was eliminated in the 1990s. Since then, SETI has continued in the form of privately funded programs. The SETI Institute, a nonprofit scientific and educational institution, is one of the most respected groups. Other organizations, universities, amateur astronomers, and even home computer users also contribute to the search. In the SETI@home project, over five million people with personal computers have helped to analyze data via the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SETI is an exercise in optimism and hope. When trying to estimate the number of advanced civilizations within the Milky Way, researchers use an equation that considers the number of habitable planets, the fraction of these that support life, the fraction that developed intelligent communication, and the fraction that exist currently. Unfortunately, scientists do not know any of the numbers needed to complete this equation. Although it seems reasonable to many that there may be intelligent life out there, the likelihood of us finding it is slim. When researchers target individual stars and scan the sky for artificial signals, they know they are only looking at a very small sample of the universe. With perhaps a few hundred billion stars in our galaxy and couple hundred billion galaxies in the universe, the search has barely begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the development of life in the universe, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.irorigins/"&gt;Infrared Search for Origins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the search for extrasolar planets, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.planetsearch/"&gt;The Search for Another Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the discovery of an unusual signal from space, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.sobell2/"&gt;Pulsars: Little Green Men&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the SETI scientists looking for? Why?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss what you think is scientific and unscientific about the SETI project, using evidence from the video to explain your answer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you think humans might react if scientists got a signal from outer space? What would it make you think about?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are hundreds of billions of stars in the universe, and possibly hundreds of billions of planets (remember that our Sun has at least 8 planets!). What do you think the chances are of other forms of life being out there &amp;mdash; unlikely, likely or probable? What do scientists and mathematicians think?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the reasons why you think one scientist says "It's as if all my training as a scientist...goes out the window" when he thinks about the question are we alone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>View this stunning collection of auroral displays from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; to find out why auroras appear in different colors and shapes and whether they occur on other planets.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Auroras are natural atmospheric phenomena created when the solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetosphere, which means that an increase in aurora activity indicates an increase in space weather. In this interactive slideshow from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt;, see stunning images of auroral displays and learn about where and how auroras are formed.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;As a dazzling effect of space weather -- conditions in space that are produced by the Sun and can affect Earth's magnetic field -- auroras are Earth's natural light show. When the gases in Earth's atmosphere interact with the perpetual stream of particles flowing from the Sun, luminous colors and shapes can be seen in the dark skies near Earth's magnetic poles. Although auroras are always present in some form, they vary in intensity, and often they are either too faint to be seen or are obscured by or clouds or daylight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weather conditions in space are determined by the Sun, which goes through an approximately eleven-year cycle of high and low activity. The strength of the solar wind -- the constant stream of charged particles flowing from the Sun's corona -- depends on the level of the Sun's activity. During times of high activity, the number of sunspots increases. These cooler, darker regions on the Sun's surface are readily observable and coincide with less visible but energetically significant intense bursts of radiation called solar flares. Other major weather events that occur with greater frequency during times of sunspot maxima include coronal holes, which release high-velocity particles, and coronal mass ejections (CME), which eject huge amounts of high-speed solar material. Events such as solar flares, coronal holes, and CMEs increase the outflow of protons and electrons in the solar wind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solar wind carries this stream of particles through the solar system, dragging the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) with it. The IMF is the magnetic field produced by the Sun, similar to Earth's magnetosphere but much larger. Typically, the magnetosphere surrounds and protects the Earth by deflecting most of the solar wind. However, when the IMF and the magnetosphere interact, some solar particles are able to leak in along the magnetic field lines at the North and South Poles, causing auroras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When high-energy particles from the solar wind collide with gases in Earth's upper atmosphere, the gases are excited. Through the same process that makes a neon sign glow, excited gas particles temporarily gain energy. When they drop back to their regular energy levels, the released energy can be seen as light in the aurora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly brilliant auroras are produced when the Sun is active or when the IMF lines up with Earth's magnetic axis, as it does around the time of the spring and fall equinoxes. However, other phenomena also result from this increased interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere. The increase of solar particles also causes significant disturbances in the magnetosphere in the form of geomagnetic storms. Such storms disrupt radio communications and navigation systems, and are also hazardous to satellites, electrical equipment, and pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the Sun's magnetic field, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.magnetism/"&gt;Solar Magnetism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the solar wind, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.solarwind/"&gt;Solar Wind's Effect on Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how different colors of light are produced, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.fireworkcol/"&gt;Fireworks! Making Color&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss what factors influence the color of an aurora.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why are both an atmosphere and a magnetosphere necessary for auroras to occur on a planet? On which planets in our solar system have auroras been observed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is space weather? How does it contribute to auroras?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do auroras occur only near the North and South Poles?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(For younger grades) If you wanted to see an aurora on a camping trip, where and when should you go?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; illustrates why carbon is at the center of life on Earth. It also asks whether carbon-based life might exist on other planets.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Carbon is the basis of all organic molecules. It is also one of the most abundant elements in the universe. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; illustrates the special characteristics of carbon that make it an essential ingredient for life.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The structure of the carbon atom allows for chemical bonding with up to four other atoms, which makes possible the vast array of chemical arrangements in organic molecules. All life on Earth depends on organic molecules, the primary components of which are also some of the most abundant elements in the universe: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally occurring elements are produced in the cores of stars by a process known as nucleosynthesis. Just after the Big Bang, when the universe was very young, the only elements present were hydrogen, helium, and a trace amount of lithium. As stars formed and nuclear fusion ignited within their cores, other elements were created. These elements are all lighter than iron, and include carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. As low-mass stars neared the ends of their lives, they lost their outer layers into space where the material became the interstellar medium -- the gas and dust between stars. Before the outer layers were expelled, convection enriched them by "dredging up" chemical elements from stellar interiors. It is thought that the majority of the carbon in the universe comes from this phase of stellar evolution. Elements heavier than iron were created in the much more dramatic endings of high-mass stars. The cataclysmic explosions of these supernovae created the intense conditions needed to form the heaviest elements, which were then also dispersed into the interstellar medium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interstellar medium is recycled to form new stars and planets. And because the relative abundances of the elements are the same throughout the universe, all planets, moons, asteroids, and comets should have the same basic ingredients available to them. In fact, observations of other stars and galaxies have shown similar chemical abundances: 98% of the mass is hydrogen and helium, and all other elements compose the remaining 2%. That 2% may not seem like much, but it is enough to create all living things on Earth. One of the most common of the remaining elements is carbon -- and organic molecules have even been observed in interstellar clouds and found in comets and meteorites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is still not clear how life on Earth originated from basic organic molecules, the fact is that life exists. If basic organic molecules were able to create life on Earth, and they are available elsewhere in the universe, it is not unreasonable to wonder if life has also developed elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about what life requires, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.lifeessential/"&gt;Life's Little Essential: Liquid Water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.water/"&gt;Ingredients for Life: Water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the elements, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.fusion/"&gt;The Elements: Forged in Stars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.ptable/"&gt;Periodic Table of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss why carbon sits "at the center of life's chemistry". Why is it one of the most versatile elements?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you think the scientist meant when he singled out forms of life based on matter?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss how carbon is important in your life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; features spectacular footage from the 1991 solar eclipse that fortuitously occurred directly over several major astronomical observatories in Hawaiʻi.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In July 1991, the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth produced a rare opportunity &amp;mdash; a total solar eclipse with a particularly long duration and a path that crossed easily accessible locations, including a major astronomical observatory in Hawaiʻi. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn about the mechanics of solar eclipses and observe the rare 1991 eclipse from the top of Mauna Kea.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;At the new moon phase, the Moon is located between the Sun and Earth, and its shadow falls toward Earth. If the three bodies align exactly, so that the Moon's shadow falls on Earth's surface, a solar eclipse is visible from Earth. During a solar eclipse, the shadow that the Moon casts consists of two parts: the umbra and the penumbra. The umbra is the dark center of the shadow where sunlight is completely blocked, and the penumbra is the outer part of the shadow where sunlight is only partially blocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People on the portion of Earth that passes through the Moon's penumbra see a partial solar eclipse &amp;mdash; the Moon's disk blocking out a segment of the Sun's light. People in the narrow path of the umbra, however, see a total solar eclipse because the Moon crosses directly in front of the Sun and completely blocks its light. Partial solar eclipses are more commonly viewed solar eclipses because the path of the Moon's penumbra on Earth's surface is significantly larger than the path of the Moon's umbra, which can only be up to about 270 km (168 mi) wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a total solar eclipse, the Sun and the Moon appear about the same size in the sky, so the Moon is able to completely obscure the Sun. The duration of time when sunlight is completely blocked by the Moon is called totality. Because orbits are not circular, variations exist in Earth's distance to the Moon and Sun, and as a result, the apparent sizes of the Moon and Sun, as seen from Earth, are not constant. When the three celestial bodies are in alignment, these variations in apparent size affect the length of totality of an eclipse, and they can also produce an annular eclipse &amp;mdash; a special type of eclipse in which a ring of the Sun remains visible around the Moon. The total eclipse in July 1991 was an unusually long eclipse, with totality lasting six minutes and 53 seconds. In addition, the eclipse was visible from several astronomical observatories in Hawaiʻi and several major cities in Central and South America, making it an unusually well-observed event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about solar eclipses, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.eclipse/"&gt;Solar Eclipses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about total solar eclipses, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.totaleclipse/"&gt;Total Solar Eclipse Animation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the Sun, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.sunbasics/"&gt;Characteristics of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the Moon's role in eclipses, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.mphase/"&gt;Phases of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>The story of how elements from lithium to uranium are created by stars is illustrated through animation and a hands-on periodic table in this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Fusion, which occurs when atomic nuclei combine to form new elements, is extremely powerful. All the stars in the universe, including the Sun, are nuclear furnaces fueled by fusion. Through fusion, stars are responsible for forming all the naturally occurring elements heavier than hydrogen and helium -- before stellar nucleosynthesis, only the lightest elements existed in the universe. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; illustrates the critical role that stars play in creating the elements.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;All matter is made up of atoms -- elements comprised of smaller particles such as protons, neutrons, and electrons. The number of protons within the nucleus -- the central component of the atom -- determines the type of element. An element can have different forms, called isotopes, based on the number of neutrons in the nucleus. For example, an ordinary hydrogen nucleus contains just one proton. But deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen, has one proton and one neutron in its nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire universe shares a common set of elements. In the very early universe, the only elements were hydrogen and helium. But since the formation of stars, lighter elements within the stars began fusing to create heavier elements, producing all the other naturally occurring elements. Under the extremely high temperatures and pressures within the core of stars, atoms collide at high enough speeds to overcome the usual electromagnetic repulsion of nuclei, allowing nuclear fusion to occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All stars live by fusing hydrogen into helium. In the first step of the process, two hydrogen atoms fuse to form deuterium. In the next step, another hydrogen atom fuses with the deuterium, creating a rare isotope of helium that has two protons and one neutron in its nucleus. In the third step, two of the rare helium atoms fuse to create a single normal helium atom and two hydrogen atoms. The fusion pathway described above requires six hydrogen atoms to create one helium atom -- however, there are two hydrogen atoms left over at the end of the process. The net result is that it takes four hydrogen atoms to make one helium atom. The energy that fuels a star is a result of the difference in mass between the original four hydrogen atoms and the resulting helium atom. Following Einstein's mass-energy relationship, E=mc2, the missing mass is converted to energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At even higher temperatures and pressures, heavier elements are able to form. Many are made from a process called "helium capture," in which a heavier element fuses with a helium atom. For example, helium fuses with carbon to make oxygen, and helium fuses with oxygen to make neon. Heavier nuclei can also fuse with each other, such as when carbon and oxygen fuse to make silicon or two silicon atoms fuse to make iron. Eventually, the interior of a massive star begins to resemble an onion, with different elements being created in different layers. However, elements heavier than iron are only produced in the extraordinary conditions created by the collapse and explosion of a star -- a supernova.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the elements, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.origin/"&gt;The Origin of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about supernovae, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.nova1/"&gt;Birth of a Supernova, Type Ia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.nova2/"&gt;Birth of a Supernova, Type II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about atomic structure, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.atoms/"&gt;Atoms: The Space Between&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3114_origins.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt; about the elements and their roles in the universe. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; lets you spin a spiral galaxy, including our own Milky Way. It demonstrates that what you can learn from visible light observations of a galaxy is largely determined by the angle from which you are observing it.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Of the 100 billion or more galaxies visible through existing telescopes, most are either spiral or elliptical in shape and about one-fourth are irregular in shape. In addition to their shape, star systems can be further classified using other characteristics, such as the type of material they contain or the angle from which they're viewed. This interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; invites users to familiarize themselves with spiral galaxies, such as our own Milky Way. The annotated visible light photographs and composites offer opportunities to learn about a galaxy's scale, composition, and rotational pattern.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Scientists look for order and patterns by classifying or systematically grouping organisms and objects according to their characteristics. From the time Edwin Hubble first established that other galaxies exist outside our own Milky Way, and created the galaxy classification system, astronomers have classified galaxies based on their general appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;spiral&lt;/em&gt; galaxy, viewed from the side, may appear as a long, thin strip, interrupted only by a bright central bulge midway across. Viewed face-on, spiral galaxies have two easily discernible components. A spherical component contains the bright central (or nuclear) bulge and a halo that contains clusters of old stars, but is largely devoid of gas and dust. A disk component contains most of the galaxy's gas, dust, and stars. The stars move around the bulge in a nearly circular orbit within spiral arms that emerge directly from the central bulge or from a distinct bar that runs through the bulge. These spiral arms contain many fully formed stars but are also the nurseries in which new stars are formed. New star formation results from the compression of gases and dust and yields the hottest and brightest stars. Hot stars emit most of their light at short wavelengths -- in the blue and ultraviolet part of the spectrum -- which explains the bluish tint of the arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy. Our Sun is positioned about two-thirds of the way from the center to the edge. Gas and dust prevent observations inward or outward along the plane of the disk using visible light, so it is difficult to know its precise shape, whether it has two or more spiral arms, or what lies at its center. Radio and infrared telescopes provide some understanding because they can detect gases, objects, and heat using wavelengths outside the visible part of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More common than spirals-- though less easily detected -- are the &lt;em&gt;elliptical&lt;/em&gt; galaxies. These galaxies contain no visible gas and dust and lack the hot, bright stars that indicate new star formation. The presence of older, giant stars may give these galaxies a reddish tint. They are classified according to numerical index range of E0 (round) to E7 (highly elliptical). Stars in ellipticals lack the well-defined rotation axis of spirals, although their orbital paths are not entirely random.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Irregular&lt;/em&gt; galaxies, as their name suggests, have no specific form and come in two types. Type I irregulars contain many young stars and, much like spirals, contain bright nebulae (clouds of gas and dust). Type II irregulars are known as interacting or disrupting galaxies. They contain a large amount of gas and dust (i.e., star-forming potential) and result from the merger, collision, or near-miss of two or more galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To view an animation of a spinning black hole located inside a spiral galaxy, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.blackhole/"&gt;Monster Black Hole in Galaxy M84&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Hubble's discovery that galaxies existed outside of our own, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.fund.hubble2/"&gt;Hubble's Expanding Universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the size of the universe, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.biguniverse/"&gt;How Big Is Our Universe?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about what different types of telescopes can "see" in space, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.ess.eiu.chandra/"&gt;Astronomical Images in Different Wavelengths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; shows how Galileo, using his newly developed refracting telescope, observed four of Jupiter's moons, the first astronomical bodies to be discovered since ancient times.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;The telescope forever changed astronomy by providing more detailed views of distant objects than was previously possible. Galileo pioneered astronomy as the first person to study the celestial objects through a telescope. His observations, including the discovery of moons around Jupiter, helped revolutionize the way people thought about the universe. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes some of Galileo's first discoveries with the telescope.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;In 1610, when Galileo first pointed his newly built telescope toward the sky, no one had ever had the capability to see distant objects in any detail, and he had no idea what to expect. Focusing on the Moon first, he discovered that its surface was not smooth as people had previously thought, but covered with craters and mountains not unlike those on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, Galileo turned his attention to another bright object in the night sky &amp;mdash; the planet Jupiter. Today, we know quite a bit about Jupiter. With a diameter about 11 times greater than Earth's, Jupiter is the largest planet around our Sun. It is so enormous that its mass is more than twice the combined mass of all the other planets in our solar system. Composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium, Jupiter is a gas giant. It has a trademark banded look that results from its turbulent atmosphere, and its Great Red Spot is a giant storm that has been raging for centuries. Jupiter also has a faint ring system and, as of May 2005, 63 known moons surround it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a very short time, Galileo discovered Jupiter's four largest moons &amp;mdash; Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, now called the Galilean moons. Each moon has unique characteristics that make it stand out in the solar system. For example, Io is the most volcanically active object in the solar system. Europa may have an ocean of liquid water beneath its icy surface and may be the best candidate for another habitable world. Callisto is one of the most heavily cratered bodies in the solar system, and Ganymede, which is even larger than the planet Mercury, is the largest moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four Galilean moons were the first celestial bodies to be discovered with a telescope. Although Galileo at first thought they were fixed stars, his continued observations showed that their positions changed on a nightly basis. Galileo soon recognized that these new objects were satellites of Jupiter. The discovery that celestial objects could revolve around something other than Earth provided strong evidence in support of the heliocentric theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about early telescopes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.engin.design.galileotele/"&gt;The Beginnings of the Telescope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.galileotele2/"&gt;Galileo's Telescope&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how Galileo's observations changed astronomy, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.galileosys/"&gt;Galileo: Sun-Centered System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about another of Galileo's astronomical discoveries, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.galileosun/"&gt;Galileo: Sunspots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; shows how Galileo used his telescope to carefully observe and study sunspots.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Galileo used his telescope to gather data about the heavens, and his observations and theories sparked much controversy. Contrary to the popular belief of the time, Galileo suggested that Earth was not the center of the universe. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, the importance of unbiased scientific inquiry is demonstrated by Galileo's observations of sunspots.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;In an effort to understand and explain nature without prejudice, scientists rely on the processes of scientific methods. Careful and systematic observations of the natural world can provide valuable data from which to interpret natural phenomena. In the early 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, however, most beliefs about the natural world were based on philosophy and religion. Galileo was part of a scientific revolution that changed this, as people began taking a more robust approach to observation, experimentation, the use of mathematics, and the understanding of nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1611, several people used the newly invented telescope to observe dark areas on the face of the Sun. At the time, no one had any idea what the dark spots might be. A German mathematician, Christoph Scheiner, hypothesized that the spots were satellites orbiting the Sun, a theory that preserved the accepted belief that the Sun, along with all heavenly bodies, was perfect and without blemishes. In contrast, Galileo's scientific observations of the dark spots led him to believe that they were actually located on the surface of the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he studied the mysterious spots, Galileo took careful notes and made daily illustrations of the Sun's appearance. Galileo noticed that when the spots approached the edge of the Sun's disk, they appeared to become narrower and their movement slowed, both of which are visual illusions of a rotating sphere. Because Galileo's eyes could not perceive the three-dimensional movement of the spots, as the spots rotated toward or away from him they appeared to move more slowly when they were at the edge of the disk. In addition, foreshortening &amp;mdash; a visual effect that distorts shape based on perspective &amp;mdash; appeared to flatten the spots near the edge of the Sun. Moreover, the spots had very irregular shapes and would sometimes appear and disappear within the disk, something that orbiting satellites would not do. Thus, Galileo realized that the sunspots must be on the surface of the rotating Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we know that Galileo's scientific approach directed him to the correct understanding that sunspots are surface features of the Sun. Sunspots are relatively cool areas &amp;mdash; about 1000 K (1800&amp;deg;F) cooler than the typical 5800 K (9980&amp;deg;F) temperature of the Sun's surface &amp;mdash; and so appear as dark spots. They are not permanent features on the surface, but are effects of the Sun's dynamic magnetic field, and they regularly change in location, number, and shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Galileo's life, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.galileolife/"&gt;Galileo: Timeline of His Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how Galileo's observations changed astronomy, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.galileosys/"&gt;Galileo: Sun-Centered System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about another of Galileo's astronomical discoveries, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.galileomoon/"&gt;Galileo: Discovering Jupiter's Moons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construct and evaluate graphs of the current sunspot cycle in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2912_galileo.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What did Galileo see that proved to him that the sunspots were not satellites orbiting the Sun, but changes on the surface?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Galileo made this important discovery by extremely patient and detailed daily observations of the Sun. Explain why this technique is critical to scientific studies, even today.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review the evidence that persuaded Galileo that the Sun rotates. Imagine you are Galileo. How would you argue your case?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At what time or times of the day and at what time intervals do you think Galileo gathered his data on sunspots?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think conservatives in Galileo's time wanted to preserve the notion that the Sun was unblemished?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In the early 1600s, most people believed that the Sun revolved around a stationary Earth. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; tells how Galileo proved that the Sun, not Earth, is at the center of our universe.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Before the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, people generally believed that Earth was at the center of the universe. Galileo, however, was not afraid to challenge existing beliefs when he published his work in support of the Sun-centered, or heliocentric, Copernican theory. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn about the two opposing worldviews and the strong piece of evidence Galileo offered to support the heliocentric theory.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The first telescopes, invented in 1608, consisted of two simple concave and convex lenses. When placed at a specified distance apart from one another, these lenses could magnify an image about three times to make distant objects appear nearer. Although the actual instruments were not readily available, news of the invention spread quickly through Europe. By mid-1609, Galileo had heard about this new device and, despite never having seen one, reproduced a low-magnification telescope using his own materials. In fact, he quickly improved upon the existing design by grinding his own lenses to make a telescope with a magnification power of eight. Within months, he had created a telescope with a magnification power of about 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Galileo did not invent the telescope, he was the first person to use it to systematically study the sky, and what he found was amazing. Through his careful observations, he recorded evidence that would eventually overthrow long-held beliefs about the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Galileo's time, the traditional view of the universe was adopted from the ideas of Ptolemy. The majority of people believed that Earth was the center of the universe and that all other celestial bodies were perfect and revolved around it. However, Copernicus had proposed a Sun-centered system, which Galileo instinctively believed was correct. Using his telescope, Galileo was able to gather quantitative evidence in support of the Copernican theory. He found many things that contradicted the geocentric view: viewed through the telescope, the Sun and Moon had visible imperfections such as sunspots and craters, Jupiter had satellites orbiting it, and Venus was orbiting the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Galileo published his book debating the Copernican and Ptolemaic systems, the Church found him guilty of heresy and sentenced him to house arrest for the rest of his life. Today, Galileo is recognized for his revolutionary work in both astronomy and physics, and has been referred to as "the father of modern science." In addition to his findings in support of the Copernican system, his theories regarding falling objects and objects in motion laid the groundwork for classical mechanics. He was also a pioneer in the approach we call the scientific method, which utilizes observation and experiment. In 1992, three hundred and fifty years after his death, the Church officially apologized for condemning Galileo and his scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Galileo's work in physics, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.galileoexp/"&gt;Galileo: His Experiments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Galileo's life, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.galileolife/"&gt;Galileo: Timeline of His Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about some of Galileo's astronomical discoveries, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.galileosun/"&gt;Galileo: Sunspots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.galileomoon/"&gt;Galileo: Discovering Jupiter's Moons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;How was Galileo able to provide additional evidence for the Sun-centered universe?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did Galileo's observations of the phases of Venus persuade him of the true nature of the solar system?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do some research on the public's reaction to Galileo's "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems." What repercussions did he face?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What role did Copernican theory play in influencing Galileo's discoveries?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the role of observation in science, using Galileo as an example.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; video segment describes the challenges presented by the frozen desert environment of Mars to NASA engineers designing two robots that will journey millions of miles to the red planet.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Mars has intrigued people for centuries, in particular because of its potential for extraterrestrial life. Today, technology has advanced to the point that scientists can actually send robots such as those used in NASA's Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission to study Mars. In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn about the MER mission and why scientists are so interested in exploring the red planet.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Compared to Earth, Mars has an incredibly harsh environment. Four decades of Mars exploration, which began in 1960, have demonstrated that the planet is an inhospitable, frigidly cold, arid place. Its surface is littered with craters and giant volcanoes and abused by planet-wide dust storms. Mars' atmosphere is so thin that the pressure is less than 1% of the atmospheric pressure at Earth's surface. The thin atmosphere on Mars contains virtually no oxygen, a requirement of life for almost all organisms on Earth, and offers no protection from incoming ultraviolet solar radiation. The planet experiences extreme fluctuations in temperature from day to night, and the average surface temperature is a frosty -63&amp;deg;C (-81&amp;deg;F). At these temperatures, water cannot exist in its liquid form, and all life, at least as we know it, requires liquid water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, Mars remains an alluring planet to explore for signs of extraterrestrial life. Despite the lack of liquid surface water, ice exists in the planet's polar ice caps and water vapor is present in the atmosphere. There is also evidence of subsurface water. More importantly, liquid surface water may have been present in the past. Previous missions to Mars have found indicators of water, such as channels that could have been carved by flowing water and characteristic erosion features in craters. This means Mars may have once been warm enough to have liquid water. Many scientists are convinced that where they can find water, there is a chance they may find life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003, the Mars Exploration Rover mission was launched with the goal of learning more about the geological history of the planet, particularly the role that liquid water may have played. To carry out this task, two robotic geologists were sent to explore the planet. The rovers, controlled by team members on Earth, had to weather the hostile environment to carry out their missions. Even for a robot, the extreme temperature changes and dusty conditions, along with the rocky and hazardous terrain, posed challenges. Nevertheless, Spirit and Opportunity landed in January 2004 and successfully completed their three-month-long primary missions. They delivered to scientists conclusive evidence that liquid water once existed on the surface of Mars. As of August 2005, the rovers were still operating, continuing their active exploration of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the mars Exploration Rover landings, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.wheretoland/"&gt;Mars Dead or Alive: Where to Land?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about extreme conditions in the solar system, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.extemp/"&gt;Extreme Temperatures on the Moon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about why life requires liquid water, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.lifeessential/"&gt;Life's Little Essential: Liquid Water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigate the variables that affect a parachute's rate of descent in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3101_mars.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the lure of Mars? Why are we so intent on getting there and studying its surface, given the huge costs in terms of time and money?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What makes the hard-working scientists so excited about this mission?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Designing a Mars rover is an enormous engineering challenge. What are at least 5 major problems the engineers needed to solve?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What tools does the Mars rover carry to collect evidence? How is the evidence transmitted to Earth?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which planet would you like to travel to and explore? Explain your answer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Jupiter's immense gravity protects Earth from asteroids. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, scientists searching for signs of life in the universe identify solar systems with Jupiter-like planets that may be shielding smaller nearby Earth-like planets from comets and asteroids.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;More than 155 planets have been found outside of our solar system since the first extra-solar planet was identified in 1995. The search has long been heavily biased towards finding massive planets with short orbits. Now, to find an Earth-like planet, scientists are looking for a planetary setup that is similar to our own, in which a Jupiter-like planet lies a good distance away from its sun. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; explores how the arrangement of planets in our solar system may have affected the development of life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Impact craters are evidence of the many cosmic collisions that have occurred in our solar system. Some of these collisions may have aided the development of Earth's physical characteristics. For example, some scientists believe that comet impacts may be responsible for the water in our oceans and for the original organic molecules from which life evolved. Other cosmic collisions have probably had a role in species extinctions on our planet. For example, the final dinosaur extinction may have resulted from environmental changes associated with a massive asteroid impact on the Yucatan Peninsula about 65 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The asteroids and comets that cause these impacts are remnants from the birth of the solar system. According to current theory, rocky asteroids were formed in the inner solar system together with the terrestrial planets, while icy comets were formed in the outer solar system beyond Neptune. Today, millions of asteroids circle the Sun in relatively stable orbits between Mars and Jupiter. Comets are found in two regions: within the plane of the solar system just past the orbit of Neptune, in an area known as the Kuiper belt, and on the outskirts of the solar system as part of the Oort cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as engineers use the gravity of planets to adjust the path of a spacecraft, the orbits of asteroids and comets can also be altered by a gravitational encounter. Jupiter, whose mass is more than twice the mass of all the other planets in the solar system combined, has a strong gravitational field. It is believed that during the development of the solar system, Jupiter's gravity perturbed the orbits of asteroids and comets, helping to clear away much of the debris in the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early solar system, these gravitational interactions probably increased the number of collisions. Countless asteroids and comets most likely vanished into the Sun or crashed into planets. But as the number of small bodies decreased in the asteroid belt, and as most comets were ejected into distant orbits to form the Oort cloud, the rate of impacts lessened. Eventually, Jupiter's immense gravity caused it to act as a shield for Earth, protecting Earth from being overly bombarded. Without the particular size and placement of Jupiter, Earth could still be subjected to intense pummeling by asteroids and comets, and life may not have been able to develop as it did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the formation of the Moon, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.moon/"&gt;The Origin of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the search for extrasolar planets, check out &lt;span class="xsl_error"&gt;App Exception: ess05.sci.ess.eiu.planetsearch&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about an asteroid impact that may have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.ess.earthsys.dinokill/"&gt;What Killed the Dinosaurs?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about planets sizes in our solar system, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.planetsize/"&gt;All Planet Sizes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; raises the provocative idea that if life can exist in the most extreme environments on Earth &amp;mdash; such as in dark, toxic caves &amp;mdash; then perhaps living things can also survive in harsh environments on other planets.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;For certain life forms on Earth, conditions that humans and other familiar organisms find hospitable can actually be deadly. Instead of a moderate climate with an atmosphere rich in nitrogen and oxygen, these organisms thrive in very hot or very cold temperatures, or in caves or deep waters where no light penetrates. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, scientists analyze communities of cave-dwelling microbes that live off simple inorganic compounds like iron and sulfur. Based on their findings, the scientists consider whether life might also exist on other planets that contain similar primitive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Caves have human and economic value for recreation, mining, and other activities. For scientists, however, caves are valuable because they offer a unique habitat for rare forms of life. The study of these cave-dwellers has contributed to our knowledge of biological adaptation and evolution. In addition, medical researchers have cultured hundreds of cave-dwelling organisms to test their ability to combat diseases, including cancer and malaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Wyoming's Kane Cave, scientists have begun to unravel a mystery that may have consequences in the debate about whether life can exist on other planets. Certain microbes that inhabit the inner recesses of this cave system survive in conditions that humans and most other organisms would find inhospitable, even deadly. These extremophiles &amp;mdash; organisms that live in conditions outside a normal range &amp;mdash; live mostly off simple inorganic chemical compounds such as iron and sulfur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some extremophiles thrive where it is hot, others where it is dark, and still others where pressure is extremely high. Some, it turns out, need all three conditions. Bacteria found deep in the volcanic regions of mid-ocean ridges suggest a possible scenario for the beginning of life on Earth. Water in deep-sea hydrothermal vents reaches temperatures of 375&amp;deg; C (707&amp;deg; F) and higher, and is rich in dissolved minerals. When hot water rising from the vents in geysers meets the cold ocean water, it cools rapidly, and minerals precipitate out of solution. In some places, the resultant compounds of iron and sulfides form "chimneys" on top of the vents. Microbes survive in this environment using only these simple inorganic chemicals for energy. Similar primitive conditions existed on early Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A parallel may also be drawn between the microbes of the deep-sea vents and those in Kane Cave. Even though the microscopic inhabitants of Kane Cave prefer acidic conditions &amp;mdash; in which they feed off hydrogen sulfide in the air and produce sulfuric acid &amp;mdash; like those in the deep-sea vents, they survive using only simple inorganic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding life in unexpected places and in conditions that are inhospitable to humans gives scientists reason to believe that life could also exist in other unexplored regions of Earth &amp;mdash; including miles beneath the surface &amp;mdash; and on other planets as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about deep sea vents and the bacteria that live around them, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.ess.earthsys.deepseavents/"&gt;Deep-Sea Vents and Life's Origins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about conditions on early Earth, in particular the effect oxygen had on the earliest life forms, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.ess.earthsys.stetteroxy/"&gt;Life Before Oxygen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a microorganism-rich mud column in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2910_caves.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is an extremophile?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the environmental challenges facing cave organisms? Explain how some organisms meet these challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After learning about the conditions under which extremophiles live, do you think it is reasonable to argue that life could probably exist on other planets? Explain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, animations of an asteroid hitting Earth are used to illustrate this widely accepted theory of dinosaur extinction and the resulting conditions that favored mammals.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Mammals &amp;mdash; the class of animals that includes humans &amp;mdash; currently thrive in many different environments and dominate Earth. However, the first mammals were small and rather insignificant compared to their contemporaries, the dinosaurs. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn how mammals flourished after the extinction of the dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Over 5,000 species of living animals are classified as mammals. These animals share common features such as warm-bloodedness, characteristic skull shapes, and mammary glands with which the females nourish their young. Although they also had these features, the earliest mammals were very different from modern mammals. Fossils have shown that mammals that existed over 200 million years ago were small and shrew- or rodent-like. Over time, these mammals evolved, becoming more like modern mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fossil evidence shows that during the Cretaceous period &amp;mdash; from about 145 million years ago to about 65 million years ago &amp;mdash; significant evolution in the variety of life on Earth occurred. Flowering plants appeared, and land and sea animals diversified. However, dinosaurs were the dominant land animals, and other animals &amp;mdash; such as mammals &amp;mdash; were constrained to limited ecological niches. These mammals were small, probably nocturnal, and based underground. Not until the dinosaurs became extinct did mammals evolve significantly and diversify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fossil record clearly shows that about 65 million years ago, Earth underwent a mass extinction. Scientists are not sure exactly what caused the extinction, but after that time, about two-thirds of all species on the planet ceased to exist. The most famous victims of this extinction event are the dinosaurs that once dominated Earth's landscape; the most famous survivors are the mammals. Scientists do not know why some species were able to survive the extinction while others could not, but the fossil record shows that mammals not only survived, they went on to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without competition from the dinosaurs, mammals had the opportunity to adapt to many more environments. As mammals evolved, they diversified, grew bigger, and adapted to new niches. Today, mammals come in all sizes &amp;mdash; from the very small to the very large &amp;mdash; and can be seen on land, in water, and even in the air. The era in which we live is often called the "age of mammals" because of the explosion in their diversity and because the largest land animals are mammals. However, in the absence of the dinosaurs, many more habitats and ecological niches became options for all surviving life &amp;mdash; not just mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about evolution, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.howhappens/"&gt;Evolving Ideas: How Do We Know Evolution Happens?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the extinction of the dinosaurs, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.ess.earthsys.dinokill/"&gt;What Killed the Dinosaurs?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about fossils, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.fossiltype/"&gt;Types of Fossils&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about another extinction, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.permtriassext/"&gt;Permian-Triassic Extinction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes how the Sun's magnetism can have an effect here on Earth, from dramatic auroras to a mini-Ice Age in the 1600s.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;The Sun &amp;mdash; Earth's main source of energy &amp;mdash; appears to shine at a constant rate. However, the Sun's magnetic field is actually constantly changing, and this affects its energy output. These variations cause effects that extend throughout the solar system. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn about some of the effects that solar activity may have on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Although the Sun appears to shine at a constant rate, this rate is, in fact, variable. At times, dark spots &amp;mdash; called sunspots &amp;mdash; appear on the Sun's surface. These sunspots, surrounded by particularly luminous areas, are a result of the Sun's magnetic field. During periods of high solar activity, the magnetic field produces more sunspots than usual and the Sun shines slightly brighter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sun's magnetic field reverses every 22 years, and the sunspot cycle reaches a maximum every 11 years. This regular cycle of maxima and minima has been well documented since the mid-eighteenth century, although the number of spots varies, with some maximum years producing nearly 200 sunspots while others yield fewer than 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the 11-year sunspot cycle, the Sun also appears to have long-term variations. From about 1650 to 1715, the Sun went through a phase of low activity and produced virtually no sunspots. During this time, astronomers observed the scarcity of sunspots and noted that auroras &amp;mdash; another effect of solar activity &amp;mdash; were also rare. Referred to as the Maunder Minimum, this period of unusually low solar activity coincided with a bout of unusually cold temperatures on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Little Ice Age (LIA) was a time of lowered temperatures in the northern hemisphere &amp;mdash; the summers were cool, the winters were long and cold, rivers froze, and sea ice was widespread. Captured in artwork, documented in papers, and preserved in tree rings and arctic ice, the LIA is known to have had extensive effects. However, the causes of the LIA are not well understood &amp;mdash; it is likely that a number of different factors influenced this climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clear coincidence with the Maunder Minimum indicates that solar activity plays a role in determining Earth's climate. If the Sun changes its energy output &amp;mdash; particularly the amount of ultraviolet light emitted, which impacts the ozone in Earth's atmosphere &amp;mdash; it affects the climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to historical records of low solar activity during the LIA, further evidence can be found in tree rings. Not only are the rings from the LIA closely spaced, they also contain high levels of carbon-14. Carbon-14 is produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays &amp;mdash; energized particles from space &amp;mdash; and is incorporated into materials such as trees. However, cosmic rays are affected by the solar wind. When the solar wind is strong, it prevents cosmic rays from entering into Earth's atmosphere, resulting in less carbon-14 in the atmosphere. Alternatively, during years of low solar activity, there is less solar wind and more carbon-14 is produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the Sun, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.sunbasics/"&gt;Characteristics of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the solar wind, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.solarwind/"&gt;Solar Wind's Effect on Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about sunspots, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.galileosun/"&gt;Galileo: Sunspots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of two scientists who inadvertently discovered microwave radiation that is now believed to be heat left over from the Big Bang.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;The study of the origin and evolution of the universe has not always been regarded as science. It wasn't until the discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) that the science of cosmology began to be truly recognized. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn how two researchers changed the future of cosmology when they stumbled upon radiation believed to be left over from the birth of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The Big Bang theory states that approximately 14 billion years ago the universe burst into being from an unknown cosmic trigger. The early universe, contained within just a few millimeters, was very hot and densely packed with matter. Ever since that initial explosion, the universe has continued to expand and cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although generally accepted as the model for the origin and evolution of the universe, the Big Bang theory is not complete. For example, it does not explain what caused the initial expansion or why galaxies formed. However, there is significant evidence that the universe did originate from such an event. Three key pieces of observational evidence lend support to the Big Bang theory: the measured abundances of elements, the observed expansion of space, and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CMB refers to the uniform distribution of radiation that pervades the entire universe. Scientists have found that there is radiation at a temperature of just about 3 K in every direction of the sky. The CMB is a nearly perfect blackbody -- a theoretical object that absorbs and emits at all wavelengths and has a characteristic spectral curve dependent on its temperature. At a temperature of 3 K, the blackbody curve peaks in the microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum. When the CMB was discovered, the temperature of the radiation strongly matched predictions from the Big Bang theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists believe that, as a nearly perfect blackbody, the CMB must have been produced by the Big Bang. Just after the Big Bang, the very early universe would have been so hot and dense that matter could exist only as free electrons and nuclei. These free particles would continually scatter photons throughout the universe, making the universe opaque. About 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe had expanded and cooled to about 3,000 K. This allowed atoms to form, scattering fewer photons and making the universe transparent to radiation. Since then, the universe has continued to expand and cool, and the photons that existed when the universe first became transparent have also expanded and cooled. These photons are now detected as the 3 K radiation of the CMB -- cooled remnants of the Big Bang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the history and fate of the universe, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.fund.unihist/"&gt;History of the Universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the electromagnetic spectrum, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.emspectrum/"&gt;The Electromagnetic Spectrum: FRONTLINE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the cosmic microwave background, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.wmap/"&gt;WMAP: "Baby Picture" of the Universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the size of the universe, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.unibig/"&gt;How Big Is the Universe?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; follows the Apollo 15 astronauts as they collect samples of ancient rock from the Moon's crust, whose discovery helps lead to a radical new theory about the Moon's origin.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Most planetary scientists expected that lunar samples brought to Earth at the end of each of the six Apollo missions would confirm one of three leading hypotheses of the Moon's origin. Instead, samples left all three explanations unconfirmed, requiring the development of a new hypothesis for how the Moon formed. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; shows Apollo 15 astronauts collecting a type of rock that would help change our understanding of the Moon's &amp;mdash; and Earth's &amp;mdash; earliest history.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;As long as people have looked up at the sky and seen the Moon, they have wondered about its structure and origin. Early observations suggested that the Moon was a flat disk that emitted its own light in the night sky and changed shape at regular intervals. Later observations through ground-based telescopes revealed the Moon's spherical shape, as well as its relative size and heavily cratered surface. From these observations, scientists developed hypotheses to explain the Moon's origin. However, it wasn't until Apollo astronauts journeyed to the Moon and returned with lunar samples that scientists were able to formulate the hypothesis of lunar origin that is widely accepted today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the first successful Apollo mission in 1969, scientists entertained three hypotheses for the Moon's origin. One said that the Moon was captured by Earth's gravity as it passed by on its way from some unknown part of the early solar system or galaxy. Another said that the Moon co-formed alongside Earth from the same interstellar cloud of dust and gas responsible for the solar system as a whole. A third said that while Earth was forming, the force of its rotation threw off a huge clump of material that ultimately became the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1969 and 1972, six manned and three automated missions recovered 382 kilograms (842 pounds) of lunar rocks and sediment. Scientists expected that analysis of these samples would provide hard physical evidence to support one of the existing hypotheses. Instead, the rocks revealed flaws in all three explanations of the Moon's origin and suggested a fourth. The lunar materials showed that the Moon was similar in composition to Earth, but lacked the high iron content characteristic of Earth's rocks. The age of the samples suggested that the Moon formed about 4.48 billion years ago, just after Earth's formation approximately 4.56 billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most surprising and important discoveries in the lunar samples was the high concentration of an igneous rock called anorthosite. This type of rock forms from magma at particular pressures and temperatures. The fact that the lunar surface is literally covered with anorthosite suggests that the Moon was once covered by oceans of molten magma. If so, the Moon must have formed at very high temperatures. Together with other evidence, this has led astrophysicists to the most widely accepted hypothesis today: Early in its history, Earth was struck by a Mars-sized asteroid and ejected molten material that ultimately became the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about physical characteristics of the Moon, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.moonsurf/"&gt;Explore the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.extemp/"&gt;Extreme Temperatures on the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.ess.eiu.galmoon/"&gt;Galileo on the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.weightworlds/"&gt;Your Weight on Other Worlds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain the theory of how and when the Moon formed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why was the anorthosite rock brought back from the Moon by Apollo 15 called the "genesis" rock? Explain in detail.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The oldest rock on Earth is 3.9 billion years old, and it is a metamorphic rock. Why do we believe Earth is actually at least 4.5 billion years old?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In what ways does the Moon influence characteristics of Earth?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is meant by an Earth-moon system?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>See what it is like to walk on the Moon by viewing this collection of QuickTime images from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt;. Stunning 360-degree panoramas from each of the six successful Apollo Moon landings are featured.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;"Exploration at its best" is how astronaut Dave Scott described his experience as he stepped onto the Moon on July 30, 1971. The Moon is probably not humankind's final frontier. However, more than 30 years after the completion of the last mission to the Moon, the Apollo missions still stand out as six of the most ambitious and heroic voyages in exploration history. These interactive images from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; provide panoramic views of each of the six Apollo landing sites and offer a hint of what astronauts faced on the surface of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Upon landing on the Moon, Apollo astronauts followed a tradition started by explorers centuries before: They planted a flag representing their country of origin in the newly discovered land. Unlike most flags, however, the ones that the astronauts brought to the Moon required some extra support to make them recognizable in images that were broadcast around the world. Metal wire supported the Apollo missions' flags to make them appear to flap gracefully, despite the complete absence of wind on the Moon's surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of wind on the Moon was just one of a host of novel conditions the 12 Apollo astronauts experienced in six missions. For example, silty Moon dust captured every footprint and infiltrated every piece of unprotected equipment. The sky appeared breathtakingly black even in broad "daylight." The Moon's gravity, at one-sixth that of Earth, allowed astronauts to jump farther and higher than they ever could on Earth, but also made controlling one's movement extremely challenging. To top it off, the astronauts faced extreme temperatures -- from -184&amp;deg;C (-300&amp;deg;F) in the shade to 101&amp;deg;C (214&amp;deg;F) in sunlight -- and a lack of breathable air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the differences between lunar conditions and those on Earth are the result of the difference in size, or more importantly mass, between Earth and the Moon. The Moon is about one-fourth the diameter of Earth, which is relatively large compared to the moons of other planets in our solar system. The Moon's mass, however, is just over 1 percent of Earth's mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important consequences of the Moon's small mass is that its gravity is too weak to maintain an atmosphere. Earth exerts a gravitational force on gas molecules, such as nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, and carbon dioxide, just as it does on much larger objects on or near its surface. The resulting blanket of gas regulates Earth's surface temperature, produces weather, makes the sky blue, and provides all the elements necessary for life. The Moon has a very weak, nearly non-existent atmosphere and thus lacks many of the conditions we take for granted here on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about the origin of the Moon, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.moon/"&gt;The Origin of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about physical characteristics of the Moon, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.extemp/"&gt;Extreme Temperatures on the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.ess.eiu.galmoon/"&gt;Galileo on the Moon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.weightworlds/"&gt;Your Weight on Other Worlds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about how the Moon stays in orbit, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.moonorbit/"&gt;Why Doesn't the Moon Fall Down?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

What might account for their formation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What impact does the lack of atmosphere have on the quality of light as seem on the Moon's surface?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you were on the Moon, what features or phenomena would you want to explore?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What challenges did the astronauts face?

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; features the first planet to be discovered outside our solar system. Its surprisingly large size and short orbit sent scientists back to their data and led them to discover similar planets.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been looking for extra-solar planets for decades, but only recently, with better equipment and improved techniques, have they finally unveiled new and unusual planets. Since 1995, over 155 planets have been discovered orbiting stars other than our Sun. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, two of the most successful planet-hunters discuss the search for extra-solar planets.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Looking for a planet outside our solar system is difficult, but not impossible. For years, scientists failed to find any extra-solar planets. However, since the discovery and confirmation of one such planet in 1995, the daunting task has become more possible. Once astronomers found a successful technique, they continued to discover extra-solar planets at an increasing rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the first extra-solar planet confused the scientific community. A massive planet, roughly the size of Jupiter, seemed to be orbiting its star in just four days. Such a short orbit indicates that the planet is very close to the star, but according to the most accepted theory of solar system formation, such a massive planet should have a fairly large orbit. Our solar system neatly fits the formation theory, with smaller rocky planets near the Sun while larger gaseous planets reside in the cooler distant regions. It seemed impossible to have a Jupiter-sized planet orbiting so closely to its star. As the observations were confirmed, astronomers questioned their understanding of solar system formation. They have since realized that the formation theory may still be correct, but that massive planets may be able to migrate inwards some time after the initial formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the discovered extra-solar planets have been massive &amp;mdash; ranging from the size of Neptune to ten times the size of Jupiter. Rather than indicating that large planets are more common than small ones, these findings may just be a result of massive planets being easier to find. Our instruments are not yet advanced enough to detect smaller, Earth-like planets, but new technology is being developed to improve the search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current research techniques rely on indirect evidence of planets. Indirect searches rely on observations of effects caused by the planet. The majority of planets have been found with the radial velocity, or Doppler, technique, which looks for a back-and-forth shift in the star's spectra due to the gravitational pull of the planet as it orbits the star. Other methods of detection include: the astrometric technique, which looks for a side-to-side wobble against the background stars; the gravitational lensing technique, which looks for a change in the positions of background stars; and the transit technique, which looks for the periodic dimming of the star by the crossing of a planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the planets in our solar system, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.planetsize/"&gt;All Planet Sizes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the search for extrasolar planets, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.planetsearch/"&gt;The Search for Another Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about another surprising astronomical discovery, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.sobell/"&gt;Pulsars: Jocelyn Bell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the Doppler Effect, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.doppler/"&gt;Stellar Velocity: The Doppler Effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3113_origins.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt; how planetary spectra can be used to search for life on other worlds. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is it so difficult to see planets around other stars?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why did the Americans think it was impossible for a gas giant to have a 4-day orbit?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss how it was possible for planets to be "hiding" in the astronomers' data. What did the American scientists find when they re-analyzed their own data, which they had been collecting for years?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the beginning of the video, our Sun is shown as being very close to its planets (including Earth) and barely larger than them. Considering proportions, distance, and the imaginary blue lines, what is wrong with the representation? How might it be shown more accurately?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does this video tell you about the processes of science?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This brief animation adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; illustrates how total solar eclipses form and explains the stages from first contact to totality.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Solar eclipses result from the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth. Total solar eclipses &amp;mdash; in which the Sun is completely blocked by the Moon &amp;mdash; are a spectacular and rare sight to witness. In this animation adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, see why solar eclipses occur and observe a simulated total eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;A total solar eclipse &amp;mdash; in which the Moon completely covers the disk of the Sun &amp;mdash; is a remarkable sight to witness. The geometry of the Sun, Moon, and Earth allows for either a solar or a lunar eclipse at least twice a year; however a total solar eclipse occurs only about once every year and a half. Total solar eclipses last only a short while and are visible only along the narrow path of totality, making these events unusual to observe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Moon crosses in front of the Sun, a series of stages occur in the solar eclipse, as seen in this animated simulation. At first contact, the Moon just begins to cover the disk of the Sun. As the Sun becomes partially eclipsed by the Moon, it appears as if a bite has been taken out of it. The Moon continues to cross in front of the Sun, progressively covering more of it until the Moon completely obscures the Sun. This second stage, called second contact, is the period of totality. During totality, the Moon completely blocks the Sun, dusk falls, and the outer atmosphere of the Sun becomes visible as a wispy ring around the Moon. Totality lasts just a few minutes. As the eclipse continues, the Moon slowly reveals more of the Sun's disk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a solar eclipse, Earth passes through a portion of the Moon's shadow that consists of two parts: the umbra and the penumbra. The umbra is the dark center of the shadow where sunlight is completely blocked, and the penumbra is the outer part of the shadow where sunlight is only partially blocked. People on the portion of Earth that passes through the Moon's penumbra can see a partial solar eclipse. People in the narrow path of the umbra, however, can see a total solar eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total eclipses are possible because, as viewed from Earth's surface, the disks of the Moon and Sun happen to appear almost exactly the same size. However, orbits are not circular, and as a result, variations occur in the distances between Earth and the Moon and Sun. These variations can create differences in apparent size; this in turn affects the length of totality and may at times produce an annular eclipse, in which a ring of the Sun's disc remains visible around the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about solar eclipses, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.eclipse/"&gt;Solar Eclipses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the total solar eclipse in 1991, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.eclipse1991/"&gt;Eclipse of the Century&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the Sun, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.sunbasics/"&gt;Characteristics of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the Moon's role in eclipses, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.mphase/"&gt;Phases of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The moon is 400 times smaller than the Sun, but 400 times closer to Earth than the Sun. What is the result of this coincidence?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is meant by the phrase "path of totality"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the stages of a total solar eclipse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>NASA scientist Steve Squyres narrates this visual tour from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; of the most revealing discoveries made by the Spirit and Opportunity rovers on Mars.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Since landing on Mars in January 2004, the Mars Exploration Rovers have helped scientists learn an amazing amount about the red planet. The sophisticated rovers far exceeded expectations with the geological clues they have dug up about the planet's past. In this interactive tour from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt;, the mission's principal science investigator, Steve Squyres, describes some of the great discoveries made by Spirit and Opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The Mars Exploration Rover mission was launched in 2003 with the goal of finding out more about the geological history of the planet and investigating the role liquid water may have played there. Life, at least all life as we know it, cannot survive without liquid water. While Mars has been declared a cold and lifeless place, scientists have had reason to believe that it may have once had a wetter and warmer environment able to support life. In an effort to find out if there was ever a chance for life on Mars, NASA's exploration strategy was to "follow the water." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Earth, when water interacts with rock or sediment substrates, it may leave behind a variety of telltale signs. For example, flowing water carves out surface features or produces characteristic formations in rocks and sediments. Small holes in rocks, called vugs, may be found where crystals once existed but have since been either dissolved by a change in the water chemistry or eroded away. High concentrations of sulfate minerals are found in rocks that were formed in or have had long exposures to water. Certain minerals, such as gray hematite, are often formed by interaction with water. Other minerals, such as the uncommon jarosite, are only formed in acidic water. If these or similar features were found on Mars, they would be clues that water once existed there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twin robotic geologists, Spirit and Opportunity, were sent to Mars to look for such evidence. Both rovers were designed to have great mobility and were equipped with identical sets of five custom-made scientific instruments. Each rover body has a panoramic camera that creates high-resolution images and a spectrometer to determine mineralogy. Each rover also has a robotic arm that holds and maneuvers miniature versions of instruments used by geologists on Earth: a spectrometer to identify the elemental composition of rocks and soil, another spectrometer to specialize in iron-rich minerals, and a microscopic imager to enable close-up views of Martian features -- the first ever seen. In addition, the rovers also have a rock-abrasion tool to scrape off the outer surfaces of rocks and expose fresh interiors for study. Using evidence collected by all these tools and their knowledge of how water interacts with materials on Earth, many scientists have become convinced that Mars once had a watery environment that may have been able to support life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about exploring Mars, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.hostenviron/"&gt;Mars Dead or Alive: A Hostile Environment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the landscape of Earth, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.erosion/"&gt;Erosion and Weathering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the dramatic landing of the rovers on Mars, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.welcometomars/"&gt;Mars Dead or Alive: Welcome to Mars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What clues did the scientists find that indicate that there may have been water on Mars?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steve Squyres stated that scientists had made a hypothesis about the crater and believed it was an ancient lakebed. On what information did they base this hypothesis? How did the data coming from the Rover support or challenge the scientists' hypothesis?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compare and contrast the formation of sedimentary and volcanic rock.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did our knowledge of Earth surface processes help scientists in their analysis of ancient Mars environments?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What instruments do geologists use to analyze rocks on Mars - a location they cannot explore in person?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; goes on a whimsical journey in search of life forms thriving in extreme conditions on Earth and in outer space. Animations show ice on Jupiter's moon, Europa, and signs that water once existed on Mars.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Earth provides a comfortable and temperate environment for a wide variety of living organisms. However, in the past few decades, scientists have discovered unusual life forms thriving in areas where the majority of living things on Earth could never survive, such as by deep sea vents or in dry deserts. This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, explores extreme forms of life on Earth, the importance of liquid water, and the possibilities of life elsewhere in the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Since the 1970s, a number of unusual organisms have been discovered in environments that are hostile to other living things. These organisms, called extremophiles because of their ability to survive at the extremes of typically hospitable conditions, thrive where other life would perish. For example, microbial life has been found deep underground in tiny spaces within rocks, in the frozen environment of Antarctica, in the searing hot waters of deep sea vents and hot springs, and in the harsh environments of dry deserts. Life has also been found in extreme conditions of high radiation, pressure, acidity, alkalinity, or salinity. With the discovery of such organisms, some scientists have broadened their definition of what a habitable environment might be to include a greater range of potential environments for extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All life has three main requirements for existence: elements, a source of energy, and a medium that allows for chemical reactions to occur. The first two requirements are readily available throughout the universe. The third requirement causes more controversy. On Earth, liquid water is that essential medium, but is it the only solvent that could sustain life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquid ammonia could possibly fulfill the role of water. In our solar system, liquid ammonia is common, and it is similar to water as a solvent. However, it would be difficult for life to survive in an ammonia environment because the temperature range in which it exists as a liquid, -78&amp;deg;C to -33&amp;deg;C (-108&amp;deg;F to -27&amp;deg;F), is very small and extremely cold. At such low temperatures, chemical reactions happen incredibly slowly, which makes it unlikely that life could arise. Based on our experience on Earth, water appears to be a crucial ingredient for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, The National Academy of Sciences has organized a group of scientists to address the limits of organic life of planetary systems. Rather than restrict the search for life to carbon and water-based organisms, the committee is evaluating the possibilities for "weird life." When stretched outside the rules of standard biology, the search for extraterrestrial life opens up even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how life might have originated on Earth, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.ess.earthsys.deepseavents/"&gt;Deep-Sea Vents and Life's Origins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.cell.stetteroxygen/"&gt;Life Before Oxygen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.lifecondtn/"&gt;Caves: Extreme Conditions for Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about carbon-based life, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.carbon/"&gt;Ingredients for Life: Carbon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the importance of water, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.lifeessential/"&gt;Life's Little Essential: Liquid Water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is water considered an essential ingredient for life?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why are scientists rethinking where life might be found?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why we are searching for evidence of past life on Mars?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Might Jupiter's moon Europa contain water beneath the vast ice sheet that covers it? Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What types of life might be present on other planets in other solar systems? What conditions would need to be met for them to occur?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; features the dramatic landing of the Spirit and Opportunity rovers on Mars.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;A mission to Mars is never a guaranteed success. During the first of two landings in the Mars Exploration Rover mission, scientists and engineers were full of anticipation and anxiety the night that Spirit was due to land. Would the rover land safely and be able to complete its mission to find out about the geological history of the planet? In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, take part in the excitement of the Mars landing and the beginning of a new era of space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The Mars Exploration Rover mission was launched in 2003 with the goal of finding out more about the geological history of the planet and investigating the role liquid water may have played there. Life, at least all life as we know it, cannot survive without liquid water. While Mars has been declared a cold and lifeless place, scientists have had reason to believe that it may have once had a wetter and warmer environment able to support life. In an effort to find out if there was ever a chance for life on Mars, NASA's exploration strategy was to "follow the water."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Earth, when water interacts with rock or sediment substrates, it may leave behind a variety of telltale signs. For example, flowing water carves out surface features or produces characteristic formations in rocks and sediments. Small holes in rocks, called vugs, may be found where crystals once existed but have since been either dissolved by a change in the water chemistry or eroded away. High concentrations of sulfate minerals are found in rocks that were formed in or have had long exposures to water. Certain minerals, such as gray hematite, are often formed by interaction with water. Other minerals, such as the uncommon jarosite, are only formed in acidic water. If these or similar features were found on Mars, they would be clues that water once existed there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twin robotic geologists, Spirit and Opportunity, were sent to Mars to look for such evidence. Both rovers were designed to have great mobility and were equipped with identical sets of five custom-made scientific instruments. Each rover body has a panoramic camera that creates high-resolution images and a spectrometer to determine mineralogy. Each rover also has a robotic arm that holds and maneuvers miniature versions of instruments used by geologists on Earth: a spectrometer to identify the elemental composition of rocks and soil, another spectrometer to specialize in iron-rich minerals, and a microscopic imager to enable close-up views of Martian features &amp;mdash; the first ever seen. In addition, the rovers also have a rock-abrasion tool to scrape off the outer surfaces of rocks and expose fresh interiors for study. Using evidence collected by all these tools and their knowledge of how water interacts with materials on Earth, many scientists have become convinced that Mars once had a watery environment that may have been able to support life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about exploring Mars, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.hostenviron/"&gt;Mars Dead or Alive: A Hostile Environment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about what the rovers found on Mars, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.upclose/"&gt;Mars Dead or Alive: Mars Up Close&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What were the characteristics of the protection system that cushioned the Mars rovers' landing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the similarities and differences between problems facing a rover landing on Mars and an egg on Earth falling to the floor from a height of six feet?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain why the scientists are so emotional in this video.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain the hopes of what Spirit and Opportunity may find on Mars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So far this mission has been successful beyond the scientists' dreams, with new data constantly being sent to Earth from Spirit and Opportunity. Do you think the possible outcomes of the Mars mission are worth the time and expense spent on the project? Explain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, engineers and scientists designing the Spirit and Opportunity rovers struggle to choose landing spots both safe enough for landing and geologically promising.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;It is not easy to get to Mars. Dozens of past missions have failed, with only a handful even attempting to land on the planet's surface. However, in January 2004, careful planning paid off when the Mars Exploration Rover mission successfully landed two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity. In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn how scientists and engineers decided where to land the rovers.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;On January 4, 2004, after traveling 487 million kilometers (303 million mi) through space, a rover named Spirit bounced 28 times and landed within 300 meters (984 ft) of its target on the surface of Mars. Another rover, Opportunity, took a very similar trip and, on January 25, landed near its mark on the other side of the planet. With two successful landings, the Mars Exploration Rover mission defied the odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, the majority of missions to Mars have been failures. Many failed at launch while others were lost in space. In its first attempted mission, the European Space Agency (ESA) scheduled its Beagle 2 to land just weeks before the Mars Exploration Rovers. Upon being released by the Mars Express orbiter, Beagle 2 was supposed to land and then establish radio contact. After months of failed attempts to communicate with the lander, the operations team had to concede that Beagle 2 presumably crashed, most likely due to an unknown technical malfunction, and would not be able to complete its mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NASA's Mars Exploration Rover mission has had a very different outcome. Not only did the rovers land safely, they have gone on to complete and surpass their mission goals. More than 100 experts worked together to choose sites that were both scientifically significant and operationally feasible. For example, the landing site needed to be low in elevation to give the parachutes enough time to slow the descent through the thin atmosphere. Despite the use of durable airbags to cushion the landers on impact, steep slopes and rocks would pose risks. High winds, dust, and proximity to the equator were additional risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data and images from past orbital missions, 155 possible sites were narrowed down to two: Meridiani Planum and Gusev Crater. Meridiani Planum was chosen because a previous orbiter mission had found it to contain a large expanse of exposed hematite, a mineral that often forms in the presence of water. As a flat open plain, it was a safe landing site for Opportunity. Gusev Crater appealed to scientists because of a dry riverbed running into it, which suggested that it may have once held a large lake. However, the strong winds around the crater made it a risky landing site. To increase the likelihood of a safe landing, the team used cameras and rockets onboard Spirit to calculate its horizontal velocity and stabilize its motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the conditions on Mars, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.hostenviron/"&gt;Mars Dead or Alive: A Hostile Environment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the science of the Mars Exploration Rover mission, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.welcometomars/"&gt;Mars Dead or Alive: Welcome to Mars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What has been, and continues to be, the driving force behind missions to Mars?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the success or failure of the majority of attempts to land on Mars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This video emphasizes the difficulties in successfully landing a vehicle on Mars. What are some of the considerations for choosing a landing site?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why did scientists choose Gusev Crater as a landing site?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What systems did engineers use to enable the rover to land safely on Gusev Crater?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Using visual models and other graphics, this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; reveals details of the December 26, 2004 tsunami that collided with coasts around the Indian Ocean.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt; Tsunami waves can be distinguished from ordinary ocean waves by many factors, including the tremendous amount of energy they carry, the great distance between their wave crests, and their capacity to travel at jetliner speeds across an entire ocean. In this interactive from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt;, explore how the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami &amp;mdash; the deadliest in recorded history &amp;mdash; was triggered, how its waves traveled thousands of kilometers largely unchanged, and what happened once the waves reached coastlines both near and far from their source. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Earth's hard outer shell, known as the lithosphere, is not continuous across the surface of the planet. Instead, it consists of 12 rigid plates between 60 km (37 mi) and 200 km (124 mi) thick that are composed of continental crust, oceanic crust, and the upper part of the mantle. These plates "float" on the underlying and more flexible layer known as the aesthenosphere. When two plates converge, pressure forces sections of crust to pile up, and mountain systems and volcanoes form on the overriding plate. Meanwhile, the subducting plate plunges deep into the mantle. Large earthquakes with epicenters located at undersea subduction zones are the most frequent causes of powerful ocean waves known as tsunamis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tsunamis carry the energy produced by earthquakes or, less frequently, other Earth disturbances such as volcanoes, landslides, and meteorites. When tsunami waves break on land, this energy is released and can cause catastrophic damage. Certain physical characteristics of tsunami waves along with the waves' behavior upon reaching land explain a tsunami's enormous capacity for destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deeper the water, the faster tsunami waves travel. Despite their high speed, in the open ocean tsunami waves have a low amplitude (height) and long wavelength (distance between crests). Because waves lose energy at a rate inversely related to their wavelength, tsunami waves typically experience very little energy loss as they travel across the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a tsunami wave nears land, its wave profile changes drastically. In the open ocean, the wave energy extends from the surface to the bottom, but in shallower water, the wave gets compressed. As the wave's leading edge interacts with the rising seafloor, it slows. The water moving in behind piles up, so that when the wave finally reaches the shore, it may have risen to tens of meters (tens of yards) in height.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the trough (or low part) of the wave is first to reach the shore, water at the shore gets drawn seaward before the peak (or high part) arrives. To help understand why this happens, imagine a string arranged in a wave pattern on a table. If you shorten the wavelength, the amplitude increases and the ends of the string pull inward. Likewise, as a tsunami wave approaches shore, its wavelength shortens, pulling water from all directions, including the shoreline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because water is very heavy -- a cubic meter weighs a metric ton -- a tsunami wave is capable of inflicting immense destruction on land. The presence of reefs and steep coastal shelves, however, can act as a breakwater to lessen the force of the wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about tsunami warning systems and the detection technologies they rely on, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.wavefuture/"&gt;Wave of the Future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about what studies of tsunamis through history can tell us about possible future events, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.oncetsunami/"&gt;Once and Future Tsunamis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

What might have been done to lessen the destructive aspect of the tsunami?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, dramatic footage of avalanches and animations of ice crystals illustrate how a layer of weakly-bonded snow can contribute to a devastating avalanche.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;There are two basic elements to an avalanche: a steep, snow-covered slope and a trigger that causes a weak layer within the snow pack to collapse. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; reveals that the shape of the ice crystals of snowflakes within a snow pack is also a critical factor. How well the crystals bond together determines how strong a snow layer is and therefore how stable the snow pack is.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Avalanches are one of nature's sudden and destructive forces. Often occurring without warning, an avalanche can shift hundreds of thousands of tons of snow quickly and with deadly speed. In avalanche-prone countries, about 100 to 200 people die each year from avalanches. Today, snowmobilers account for the highest percentage of avalanche deaths in the U.S., followed by skiers, snowboarders, climbers, and others involved in backcountry recreational activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snow pack is made of both strong and weak layers. Strong layers are usually composed of small, angular snow crystals that interlock to create strong bonds. Weak layers tend to be composed of granular snow crystals that bond poorly. Weak layers prevent strong layers from bonding with one another, thereby creating an unstable situation. When a weak layer lies atop a strong layer, there is no problem. But when the situation is reversed, and the overlying weight becomes too much for the weak layer to support, it collapses and the snow above it slides downhill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, weak layers give way quickly, producing small avalanches. However, when frozen melt-water called "melt crust" forms between the snow crystals, it permits the weak layer to hold longer. When a weak layer remains in place for a long time and more and more snow accumulates above it, the size of a potential avalanche increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slope's gradient (or angle), directional aspect, and topographic features all help determine whether its snow will slide. Of these factors, gradient is the most important. Almost all avalanches occur on slopes between 35 and 45 degrees. Precipitation, wind, and temperature also influence the stability of a snow pack. Of these, wind is the most common cause of avalanches. Windblown snow can collect 10 times faster than falling snow, eroding snow from windward slopes and moving it to downwind slopes. The additional weight of wind-driven snow subjects the weak layers below to additional stress and is often enough to precipitate a collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By looking at the layers within a snow pack and applying what they know about the response of snow crystals to changing environmental conditions, avalanche researchers can detect weaknesses where collapse might occur. Data about past avalanches, including location, frequency, and prevailing weather conditions, can further aid their predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about one fishing village's experience with a deadly avalanche in Iceland and the safety plan devised in response to the event, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.iceland/"&gt;Avalanche Town&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a model to investigate the complexities of snowpack formation in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2418_avalanch.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, scientists are on the hunt for tornadoes. Using Doppler radar, they gather data in the hopes of solving the mystery of how tornadoes form.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;From an outsider's perspective, storm chasing might appear to involve hours and hours of boredom, accentuated by a few moments of unimaginable excitement &amp;mdash; or terror &amp;mdash; depending on one's love or fear of tornadoes. But to tornado researchers, the effort and expense they expend in search of a single tornado-producing storm reflect the importance of these events in terms of their impact on lives and property. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; follows some of the scientists who study these violent storms and highlights what they've learned about the storms and what they still want to know about the conditions that cause them.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The capricious nature of tornadoes, coupled with the devastating damage they leave in their wake, has made their study a priority. Storm-chasing meteorologists spend months scanning the skies and reading output from weather radar systems in search of conditions that coincide with tornadoes. They are lucky if they see two per season. Still, their tireless effort has yielded our best understanding yet of the atmospheric conditions that give rise to the most violent of all weather events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meteorologists tie tornado formation directly to the most severe of all thunderstorms: supercells. These storms typically form in the United States when warm, moist air coming from the Gulf of Mexico encounters cool, dry air over the plains and Midwest. The warm air rises above the cooler air mass because it is less dense. As it does, moisture in the air condenses, releasing heat. The heat fuels the continued upward movement of the air column. Tornadic rotation can result from the rising air of the updraft interacting with the horizontal winds of the storm. These horizontal winds can move in different directions and at different speeds. Scientists also know that supercells drive intense downdrafts, and think that they may have a role in concentrating the rotating winds inside the storm and pulling them to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doppler radar has been instrumental in helping researchers both to understand the role of downdrafts, and by extension, better predict where tornadoes might occur. This technology enables meteorologists to see the direction storms are moving, and also to read the intensity of precipitation and the wind speed inside them. It does this by emitting electromagnetic waves that bounce off water droplets inside a storm cloud. The radar receiver catches these waves on their return and a computer calculates the storm's wind speed and direction based on the change in frequency of the returning waves. Tornadoes show up on the Doppler radar images. Under certain conditions, such as those depicted in the video segment, the radar image shows hook-shaped wind patterns. This is a result of the downdraft coupled with the rotating wind of the storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computer simulations have also allowed researchers to experiment with variables to better understand the atmospheric conditions that result in tornado formation. Computer modeling has revealed a number of clues, such as the possible role of tiny swirling winds near the ground that coincide with tornado formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As yet, however, researchers lack sufficient data to explain exactly how thunderstorms turn into tornadoes. The fact is, most storms don't. Perhaps understanding why will help scientists uncover the necessary trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the science behind tornadoes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.downdraft/"&gt;How Do Tornadoes Form?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the threats tornadoes pose and the damage they cause, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.tornado/"&gt;Rate Tornado Damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.tornkansas/"&gt;Tornado Chaser Footage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3107_tornado.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt; how to identify the best time of year to see possible tornado outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

What could storm chasers say that would cause you to support their research?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; explains the difference between weather and climate and features groundbreaking analysis revealing that Earth's climate has changed much faster than previously believed.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Weather is notoriously unpredictable. From one moment to the next, any of dozens of atmospheric variables can change to create a new weather event. In contrast, climate descriptions, which identify average and normal temperatures and precipitation levels, tend to be perceived as stable, at least over time scales that humans can easily relate to. However, that hasn't always been the case. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes climate data that suggest the Earth has undergone dramatic climate shifts in relatively short spans of time.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Environmental conditions are constantly in flux. Many of these changes may escape our notice: Temperatures rise and fall throughout the day, humidity and air pressure fluctuate, and clouds form and dissipate. However, these same variables can combine to create phenomena that are readily observable, such as wind, rain, snow, and thunderstorms. These relatively short-term environmental changes, which might occur over periods of hours, days, weeks, or seasons, are collectively referred to as &lt;em&gt;weather&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climate&lt;/em&gt; describes environmental conditions over much longer periods of time than weather forecasts and reports. These long-term environmental analyses characterize a specific geographic location's temperature and precipitation averages and ranges. Anomalous high and low readings are absorbed by these averages, resulting in a reliable estimate of expected normal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the global climate is, by definition, more stable than local weather. But climate is also constantly changing. In fact, research conducted over the last 20 years or so describes dramatic shifts in climate in Earth's distant past. These shifts occurred over a period of a decade or less, rather than over thousands of years as scientists once thought was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists began studying evidence of climate change, especially the role of ice ages in Earth's geologic history, more than a century ago. During the most recent ice age, the Pleistocene, average global temperatures were about 5&amp;deg;C or more below present temperatures. This and other ice ages detected in the geological record were set in motion by gradual changes in the Earth's tilt, rotation, and orbit over thousands of years. Despite the gradual nature of these changes, Earth's climate appears to respond rapidly once certain boundary conditions are set in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layers of ice analyzed from Greenland ice cores provide a chronology detailing the rapid onset of ice age conditions. They show average continental surface temperatures rising and falling dramatically in just a few years, rather than over the course of hundreds or thousands. For example, between 43,000 BC and 8,000 BC, average global temperatures fluctuated periodically by as much as 20&amp;deg;C (36&amp;deg;F) or more. In contrast, climate changes since 8,000 BC have been characterized by temperature shifts of just 4&amp;deg;C (7&amp;deg;F) or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many climatologists think these events resulted from changes in heat energy transfer by ocean currents from the tropics to the higher latitudes, caused by a decrease in salinity. For example, computer models suggest that around 13,000 years ago, the Gulf Stream waters, which warm northwestern Europe, might have been altered or halted dramatically by influxes of fresh water from melting glaciers. However, scientists do not understand the specifics of how a decrease in the rate of energy transfer by the ocean currents from the tropics to the higher latitudes translates to changes in regional and global climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about the role greenhouse gases may play in global warming, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.greenhouse2/"&gt;Global Warming: The Physics of the Greenhouse Effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the role ocean currents have played in climate change, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.convey/"&gt;Great Ocean Conveyor Belt: Part I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.convey2/"&gt;Great Ocean Conveyor Belt: Part II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about the role orbital cycles have played in Earth's climate, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.naturalchange/"&gt;Natural Climate Change in Djibouti, Africa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain the relationship between climate and weather using examples from the video.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain why floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes are aspects of weather, not climate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The video points out how dramatic climate changes have been in the past. Do we know the possible triggers of these rapid shifts? Is it possible that we may experience one of these dramatic shifts in our lifetime?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The graph of average temperatures shows that today's temperatures are higher than they were 10,000 to 40,000 years ago. It also shows that today's temperatures have been dropping in the past centuries. However, what doesn't show on this graph is that temperatures have been increasing over the past several decades. What do most scientists believe is contributing to this increase in temperature?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you think of other possible ways scientists can determine what climate was like in the past besides studying ice cores?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, scientists use computer simulations to explore the question of how supercell thunderstorms produce tornadoes.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;On average, about 800 tornadoes occur in the United States each year. They can appear and disappear in moments, and key details about their formation are unknown. These factors make the research to understand and predict tornado occurrence extremely difficult. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes the challenges of studying tornadoes and shows how computer simulations are helping researchers observe what they can't possibly see in a real storm.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The damage tornadoes leave in their wake can be breathtaking and otherworldly: trees snapped like matchsticks, vehicles thrown hundreds of meters, and homes reduced to foundations. Scientists estimate that the most powerful of these terrifying storms produce winds topping 500 kilometers per hour. Meter for meter, they're considered the most violent of all weather events. Yet, surprisingly, they harness only a fraction of the energy contained in the storms that spawn them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tornadoes are powerful precisely because they concentrate huge amounts of energy into columns of air often just a couple of hundred meters in diameter. This intense concentration requires that a variety of weather variables and events occur in precise combination. Meteorologists are working hard to identify some of these variables in an effort to improve the predictability of one of Earth's most unpredictable phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The formation of the most intense tornadoes requires the most powerful of all thunderstorms, called supercells. These storms, which account for less than 10 percent of all thunderstorms, typically form in the United States in the spring, between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. In this area, warm, moist air moving north from the Gulf of Mexico clashes with cooler, drier air, and the warm, less-dense air rises and cools. As it does, the moisture in the air begins to condense. This releases heat, which fuels the air's continued upward movement. Supercells differ from average thunderstorms in that they develop internal rotating features known as mesocyclones and are generally longer-lived. Changes in the wind speed and direction of a rising column of air together with the unstable air masses of the Great Plains cause supercell updrafts to be extremely powerful. With extreme instability in the environment and changing winds leading to rotating mesocyclones, supercell thunderstorms are ripe for producing tornadoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, only about 20 percent of the strongest supercells result in tornadoes. Scientists aren't certain why, since some of the factors that trigger the last steps of tornado formation aren't known, but they think they have some leads. One possibility is that powerful downward winds caused by heavy precipitation, called downdrafts, wrap around and concentrate winds rotating in the supercell. Computer models have brought to light another possibility: They show many tiny columns of spinning air, called vortices, very close to the ground just before a tornado develops. Scientists hypothesize that these vortices join together and, in so doing, form the tornado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the tornado research, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.chasing/"&gt;Chasing Tornadoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the threats tornadoes pose and the damage they cause, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.tornado/"&gt;Rate Tornado Damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.tornkansas/"&gt;Tornado Chaser Footage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are some of the ingredients necessary to produce a tornado?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How have computers helped scientists learn about tornadoes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the basic weather data that are fed into the computer tornado-generation model?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the role of downdrafts in the formation of a tornado?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tornadoes are described as a dance of wind, moisture, and terrain. Explain this statement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, a detailed map showing the trajectories of abandoned ships from the late 1800's is used to reveal the routes of surface currents in the Atlantic Ocean. Animations illustrate the role played by ocean currents in the colonization of North America.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Abandoned ships and other objects lost at sea may ride ocean currents for months or even years before sinking or washing ashore. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes what scientists have learned about one important ocean current, the Gulf Stream, by studying the paths of ships abandoned during the late 1800s.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Ocean currents have been steering the course of sailing vessels for centuries. These bands of water, which may extend several hundred meters below the surface and move at up to 10 kilometers (6 miles) per hour, have aided the discovery of new lands. For example, Indonesian natives settled Madagascar more than 1,500 years ago at the end of a 6,400-kilometer (3977-mile) canoe journey along the South Equatorial Current. In other instances, currents have doomed sea voyages. In the year 990, only 14 out of 25 Viking ships bound for Greenland landed safely. For weeks, the aspiring settlers aboard these ships battled storms and the eastward-moving currents of the North Atlantic Drift and the Gulf Stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gulf Stream was important to the founding and settling of North America. This current, which carries warm water from the southern tip of Florida, along the east coast of the United States, and across the North Atlantic Ocean, enabled ships to travel from colonial America to Britain in less than a month. However, for those who did not know to steer clear of the Gulf Stream on their return trip, their journey was much more arduous, taking two months on average. Those who tried to avoid the current by hugging the coastline instead of taking the more southerly route sometimes ended up shipwrecked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movement of ocean currents is affected by global wind patterns around Earth. Global winds form three separate bands in the northern and southern hemispheres. These wind patterns result from a combination of greater solar radiation at the equator than at the poles, Earth's rotation, and the Coriolis effect. The uneven distribution of heat from solar radiation creates pressure differences, which cause the movement of air, or wind. Earth's rotation and the Coriolis effect cause airflow to be deflected in an eastward or westward direction in addition to its northward and southward flow. Ocean currents mirror these wind patterns to an extent. However, because continents impede the flow of water, the currents are not aligned in three distinct bands. Instead, they form cyclical patterns, called gyres, around the perimeter of Earth's oceans and seas. In the northern hemisphere, gyres move in a clockwise direction and in the southern hemisphere they move in a counterclockwise direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, scientists have used many techniques to map and model the movement of ocean currents. For example, Benjamin Franklin &amp;mdash; who named the Gulf Stream &amp;mdash; relied on the observations of whalers and his own temperature measurements to map the warm waters of this current. Others have used records of the paths, or trajectories, of abandoned ships, called derelicts, as well as reports of recovered cargo lost from ships, to plot the direction and speed of ocean currents that propelled the objects. This information, combined with what has been obtained from more sophisticated instruments such as satellite-tracked buoys, has helped scientists better understand ocean currents and has made ocean travel safer and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the causes and paths of ocean currents, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.globalsurf/"&gt;Examine Global Surface Currents&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.gulfstream/"&gt;What Causes the Gulf Stream?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the role ocean currents have played in climate change, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.convey/"&gt;Great Ocean Conveyor Belt: Part I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.convey2/"&gt;Great Ocean Conveyor Belt: Part II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; follows the clean-up effort after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off the coast of Alaska. Also featured is a marsh where an oil spill occurred 20 years earlier; analysis suggests that environmental damage may last for decades.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Coastlines serve as both physical and biological frontiers between land and sea. They are highly vulnerable to pollution from contaminated rivers as well as from urban waste and industrial products that are discharged at sea and wash up on shore. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; features one of the largest oil spills in history: the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound, the costliest industrial accident to date.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Several well-documented events demonstrate that oil spills can greatly impact shorelines, plant and animal life, and the local economy. Even following intensive cleanup efforts, when the immediate problem appears to have been resolved, the question remains: How long does un-recovered oil remain in an ecosystem and what impact can it have?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because oil is less dense than water, it floats on the water's surface. After a spill, a large boom, or barrier, is generally placed around a portion of the oil and its source. Specialized equipment, such as a vacuum, is then used to help remove oil from the water's surface, and chemical detergents are applied to help break up visible slicks. After human efforts have been exhausted, natural processes &amp;mdash; in particular evaporation and the cleansing action of waves breaking on shore &amp;mdash; deal with what remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left to weather, all but the thickest grades of oil will evaporate. Just how fast this happens, however, depends on whether the oil is light, like gasoline, or heavier, like most crude oils. Knowing the amount and type of oil leaked in a spill, scientists can estimate how much will evaporate in a given time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What doesn't evaporate must be collected through cleanup activities &amp;mdash; otherwise it remains in an ecosystem. In the case of the Valdez, between 13.2 and 26.5 million liters (3.5 and 7 million gallons) of oil was unaccounted for following cleanup efforts. Oil that coalesces and sinks can remain in the seabed sediment for years. What reaches shore can settle in sub-surface layers. Buried as it is, there is little if any opportunity for it to be naturally removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animals that inhabit these spill zones may not be completely safe from contamination after the clean-up effort is over. Most toxic components in oil tend to rapidly evaporate, and thick deposits that can cover or suffocate shore animals soon break up, so immediate mortality is localized and on a small-scale. However, questions about non-lethal effects of exposure or ingestion &amp;mdash; such as impaired reproduction, growth, or feeding &amp;mdash; remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sedentary animals &amp;mdash; such as filter-feeding oysters, mussels, and clams &amp;mdash; are most likely to accumulate oil components in their tissues. While these components may not be dangerous to the animals' own health, a strong and lasting odor may make them unsuitable for human consumption. What's more worrying, however, is that organisms that accumulate toxins may pass them down the food chain. This process, called bioaccumulation, has been linked to the persistent reproductive failure of harlequin ducks in Prince William Sound following the Exxon Valdez incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the influence of environmental conditions and coastline features on how oil spills spread, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.oilspill/"&gt;What Happens When an Oil Spill Occurs?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

How much of it were workers able to clean up?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you think might be the long-term impacts of oil remaining in the environment?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; visualizes how Earth's rotation and uneven heating from the Sun cause prevailing winds and influence ocean surface currents. An animation and infrared satellite image illustrate the shape and direction of the Gulf Stream System in the Atlantic Ocean.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Even with the waves lapping at their feet, few people consider ocean currents and their importance to global climate. Although the Gulf Stream cannot be seen flowing by off North America's East Coast, in Western Europe, the current's warming effect is undeniable. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; uses satellite imagery to illustrate the Gulf Stream's path and animations to explain how atmospheric phenomena cause it to move.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Ocean currents move in response to global wind patterns and Earth's rotation. Uneven heating of Earth creates global winds that form three separate bands in each of the northern and southern hemispheres. Earth receives more solar radiation at the equator than it does at the poles, and this uneven distribution of heat creates pressure differences, which in turn cause the movement of air, or wind. Earth's rotation causes fluids &amp;mdash; both air and water &amp;mdash; to be deflected as they move across our planet's surface. This is known as the Coriolis effect. The Coriolis effect causes winds to move in an eastward or westward direction in addition to their northward or southward flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ocean currents mirror these wind patterns to some extent. However, continents impede the flow of water. When currents encounter a landmass, they are deflected and ultimately form circular patterns, called gyres, around the perimeter of Earth's oceans and seas. The Coriolis effect acting on these currents causes northern hemisphere gyres to move in a clockwise direction and southern hemisphere gyres to move in a counterclockwise direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gulf Stream forms the western edge of the North Atlantic Gyre. Originating near the southern tip of Florida, this swift, warm current travels along the east coast of the United States and across the North Atlantic. South of Greenland, the Gulf Stream widens and slows, becoming a vast, slow-moving, warm current known as the North Atlantic Drift. Further on, the North Atlantic Drift splits. One part continues north as the Norway Current. The other, the Canary Current, heads south toward the northwest coast of Africa, where its waters are warmed again by the intense solar radiation in the tropics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gulf Stream reaches depths of up to several hundred meters (a thousand feet) below the surface and travels up to 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) per hour. It moves as much as 100 million cubic meters (3.5 billion cubic feet) of water per second. By comparison, the Mississippi River moves about 15,000 cubic meters (530,000 cubic feet) per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more important than the volume of water moved by the Gulf Stream is the heat it carries and the effect of that heat on climate. Living at 51 degrees north latitude, Londoners might expect their winters to resemble those in Calgary, Alberta. At 60 degrees north latitude, the west coast of Norway should look very much like Siberia in January. Instead, the Gulf Stream delivers a steady flow of heat to the atmosphere near the North Atlantic. As a result, London sees plenty of rain but very little snow. And the west coast of Norway remains ice-free all winter, not at all like Northern Saskatchewan or Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the role ocean currents have played in climate change, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.convey/"&gt;Great Ocean Conveyor Belt: Part I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.convey2/"&gt;Great Ocean Conveyor Belt: Part II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the causes and paths of ocean currents, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.globalsurf/"&gt;Examine Global Surface Currents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is Earth heated unevenly? What effect does this have on the atmosphere?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the principal cause of surface currents in the ocean?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If someone asked what the Gulf Stream is, what would you tell them?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the role of wind in the location and movement of the Gulf Stream?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use specific examples to explain how the Gulf Stream influences climate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; features new advances in predicting the intensity of hurricanes.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Katrina, which struck New Orleans and other Gulf Coast communities on August 29, 2005, provided the worst kind of reminder of the importance of accurate hurricane prediction &amp;mdash; and of heeding those predictions. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; a year before Katrina struck, describes the current state of research into what causes hurricanes and how scientists are now able to "see" inside the storms in their ongoing efforts to more accurately predict both the path and intensity of these powerful storms.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Tropical cyclones are the most powerful weather events on Earth. These storms, also known as hurricanes and typhoons, depending on where they form, produce sustained winds of at least 119 kilometers (74 miles) per hour. They can dump rain at a rate of more than three centimeters (1.2 inches) per hour and trigger sudden, unpredictable surges in ocean tides that cause extensive property damage and loss of life. In 2004, for example, Hurricane Jeanne struck the Caribbean nation of Haiti, killing more than 3,000 people and nearly destroying the coastal city of Gona&amp;iuml;ves. By late 2005, the death toll from Hurricane Katrina had surpassed 1,300, and property damage estimates had grown to several billion dollars. In an attempt to save lives and mitigate damage caused by hurricanes, scientists have gone to great lengths to better understand these storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hurricanes originate over warm tropical oceans. It is the heat of the water that provides the developing storm's energy. In fact, water that is less than 27&amp;deg;C (80&amp;deg;F) does not possess sufficient heat to generate and sustain a hurricane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hurricane begins when winds blowing across the surface of the warm ocean water form clusters of strong thunderstorms known as tropical disturbances or tropical waves. The warm water fuels these thunderstorms, causing them to rise. As they do so, they draw water vapor off the ocean surface. When the rising air cools, the water vapor condenses to form clouds, a process that releases heat. This heat warms the center, or eye, of the storm, causing more surface water to evaporate. Meteorologists call this cycle a "heat engine." As long as a storm has access to warm ocean water, this engine will continue to drive the hurricane's growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the early 1990s, some of the most important advances in hurricane research have been in satellite imagery. Today, satellites use infrared and microwave imagers to record air temperature and humidity, as well as the surface temperature of tropical oceans where hurricanes form. Satellite altimeters measure ocean surface height, helping scientists determine the locations of high-energy swells. In addition, satellite radar now allows scientists to observe the intensity of thunderstorms that form inside hurricanes. These storms, called "hot towers," may reach heights of 14.5 kilometers (9 miles) above the ocean surface. Scientists have found that the presence of hot towers in a developing tropical storm indicates a high probability that the storm will intensify into a hurricane within hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the threat hurricanes pose to coastal communities, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.neworleans/"&gt;Hurricanes: New Orleans Under Threat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.katrinavid/"&gt;Hurricane Katrina: A Scientist's Response&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.katrinawet/"&gt;Hurricane Katrina: Wetland Destruction&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how hurricanes form, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.hurrlife/"&gt;How Hurricanes Form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about the correlation between hurricanes and El Ni&amp;ntilde;o, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.eshurricane/"&gt;Earth System: El Niño's Influence on Hurricane Formation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Model how wetlands reduce the intensity of a hurricane in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3204_02_nsn.html" target="blank"&gt;NOVA scienceNOW classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weather radar can now obtain images inside a hurricane. How could these images be used to predict the intensity of a storm?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the hypothesis about the effect of the "hot towers" in a hurricane is correct, what do you think the meteorologists will be able to predict?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are the mayor of a Gulf Coast city and need to make a decision about evacuating the city. What factors will help you make a proper decision? Bear in mind that if you make a wrong decision, it will anger many people and cost millions of dollars in losses. Will the ability to predict the intensity of hurricanes minimize the risks of ordering an evacuation or not?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>The impact of natural disasters is made vivid in this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;. A small town in Iceland, prepared for recurrent avalanches, is devastated when one takes a new and damaging path.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In 1995, an avalanche overran an unsuspecting fishing village in Iceland, killing 20 of its residents. Although avalanches are a common occurrence in the region, this was the first avalanche in this village's history to travel as far as the city center. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn more about the Iceland avalanche and how engineers plan to protect the village from future avalanches. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;In Iceland, avalanches are common occurrences. Snow piles up on steep mountain slopes, only to slide down when the weight of overlying snow layers overwhelms the strength of underlying layers. However, despite precautions taken by the fishing village of Flateyri, which included designating an avalanche danger zone based on previous recorded events, an avalanche inundated the area in October 1995. The avalanche sent 300,000 cubic meters (392,385 cubic yards) of snow down the side of a mountain in a flow measuring between 3 to 10 meters (10 to 33 feet) deep. In less than 30 seconds, 20 residents in the small village had been killed, and 17 houses destroyed &amp;mdash; all but one of which were outside the specified danger zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the Flateyri avalanche, the Icelandic government directed risk-assessment activities to revise danger zones in avalanche-prone areas nationwide. Their revamped safety plan also allowed for the creation of structures engineered to divert any future snowslide away from populated areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avalanche researchers must confront the same reality faced by researchers of other recurring natural hazards, such as earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, and hurricanes: forces of nature can be unpredictable. Although humans cannot prevent natural disasters from occurring, we can try to minimize their impact on communities. By understanding data related to the location and frequency of past events, the geologic or weather conditions that spawned these events, and the intensity or extent of damage of both past events and potential ones, researchers can provide detailed hazard maps identifying vulnerable areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, thanks to better forecasts, improved communications systems, and public education programs, the efforts of disaster researchers from all fields have successfully reduced the loss of life. Still, an event more extreme than the worst-case scenarios researchers generate using research data could always occur. Despite all the advances of modern science, nature may always have the last word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how snow packs form and the environmental factors that can cause avalanches, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.avalanche/"&gt;How Do Avalanches Form?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about some other types of natural disaster prediction, warning, and mitigation schemes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.tornado/"&gt;Rate Tornado Damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.wavefuture/"&gt;Wave of the Future&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.japan/"&gt;Earthquake Prediction&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.hurricane/"&gt;Hurricanes: New Tools for Predicting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The community had used history as their guide in determining the danger zone for avalanches in their town. Why were the data they used insufficient to accurately predict the path of this avalanche?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How are scientists helping this community in Iceland deal with their location near an avalanche path?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how a "deflecting" wall is designed to work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are some other examples of people using piles of soil to control nature? For each example, what natural events they are trying to control?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investigate other communities affected by their proximity to an area prone to natural disasters and identify the precautions they take to avoid fatalities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive resource adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; features a collection of images that show what would happen to selected coastlines around the world if the Antarctic Ice Sheet melted.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This interactive resource adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; portrays what might happen to world coastlines if entire sections of the Antarctic Ice Sheet were to melt. By comparing present-day coastline positions with those from the peak glacial advance 20,000 years ago, you can begin to appreciate how much water is contained in glaciers, the importance of monitoring their condition, and the impact accelerated global warming could one day have on sea level.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The well-documented retreat of the world's glaciers is widely viewed as a direct result of global warming. Though scientists cannot be sure whether or when these frozen repositories will add their entire freshwater contents to the world's seas, they do know that their melt water would raise global sea level. Moreover, a rapid rise in sea level -- which we are more and more certain is occurring through accelerated atmospheric warming -- would have consequences that are not immediately apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, glaciers are found on all of Earth's continents except Australia. The two largest -- the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets -- contain about 90 percent of the planet's freshwater supply, which is enough to raise global sea levels 60 meters (200 feet). Glaciers can form at either at an altitude or at sea level anywhere that snow and ice remain year-round. They grow slowly over thousands of years, as snowflakes from one snowfall are compacted and eventually turn to ice under the weight of subsequent snowfalls. Glaciers grow only if new snow exceeds what is lost through melting or evaporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason glaciologists study glaciers is to learn more about their past so that they can better predict how glaciers will respond to climate change in the future. In addition, glacial deposits archive data that can be used to reconstruct environmental conditions in the past. For example, bands of light and dark snow in ice core samples indicate seasonal changes. Light layers are deposited in summer, and dark layers in winter. The layers vary in color because summer and winter snows have different densities and crystal shape. Taken together with other historical climate data concerning solar radiation, the presence of atmospheric dust, and the atmosphere's chemical composition, glacial deposits provide a timeline record of past environmental change that includes changes in air temperature as well as tectonic events such as volcanic eruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scientific report endorsed by the United Nations states that unless greenhouse gas emissions are curtailed, average global temperatures may rise between one and three degrees Celsius (two and six degrees Fahrenheit) in the next hundred years. The ramifications of a temperature change at just the low end of this range would be severe. A one-degree Celsius (two-degree-Fahrenheit) change in temperature is predicted to result in a one-meter (three-foot) rise in sea level, which would displace millions of people in coastal cities and low-lying islands. For example, virtually all of the agricultural land in Bangladesh would be covered in seawater and rendered unusable. Another consequence of increased global temperatures would be an acceleration of glacial melt in mountain valleys, which would in turn result in massive flooding in their drainage basins. Rivers that are currently glacier-fed would dry up, impacting agriculture and other economic activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the role glacial ice plays in the Earth system, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.esglaciers/"&gt;Earth System: Ice and Global Warming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how rising atmospheric temperature may be affecting the speed with which ice sheets move, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.icestreams/"&gt;Antarctic Ice Movement: Part II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about dramatic changes in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.sealevel/"&gt;Antarctic Ice: Sea Level Change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What role does the Antarctic Ice Sheet play in climate?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What might cause the ice sheets to melt?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how the melting of the ice sheet in Antarctica could cause a rise in sea levels in Florida.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If sea ice (frozen salt water that is floating in the Arctic and Antarctic oceans) melts, will the sea levels rise? Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(For Grades 9-12) Imagine that you are the President of the United States. How would you prepare the United States for the melting of the Antarctic Ice Sheet? What data would you request from scientists to help you plan? Develop a scenario for coastal cities if either the East or West ice sheets were to melt. Which industries would suffer the most adverse effects? Which would benefit the most? What would be the three most essential preparations citizens of the U.S. could make for this melting scenario? How should the United States government be involved internationally? (reference the tsunami catastrophe)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This media-rich essay from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNow&lt;/em&gt; explores new research into hurricanes that may help explain Katrina's devastating impact and discusses the possibility that global warming played a role.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Katrina, one of the most powerful storms to strike the United States in the last 100 years, devastated New Orleans, Louisiana, and other Gulf Coast communities when it blew ashore on August 29, 2005. Not long after the storm, a &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; contributor asked hurricane experts whether Katrina represents the latest in a trend of increasing hurricane activity, and if so, why. This media-rich essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; Web site reports what he learned.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Roaring onto the Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 225 kilometers per hour (140 miles per hour), Hurricane Katrina dumped rain at a rate of more than 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) per hour for several hours and pushed a swell of ocean water more than 6 meters (20 feet) above normal along this vulnerable coastline. Two days after the storm abated, more than 80 percent of New Orleans, Louisiana, lay under water &lt;em&gt;--&lt;/em&gt; some areas by as much as 6 meters (20 feet). Thousands of residents who had successfully weathered the storm were left stranded in or on top of their flooded homes &lt;em&gt;--&lt;/em&gt; many for several days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The devastating storm prompted its own endless flood of questions about how and why such a disaster had occurred. Many people demanded to know who was responsible for failing to fully evacuate the city and to provide adequate aid for those stranded by the storm. Others wondered to what extent human activities might have played a role in Katrina's destructive power. What effect did land-use practices along the Gulf Coast have on the catastrophe? What, if anything, did global warming have to do with what seemed to be one more in a run of increasingly powerful Atlantic hurricanes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katrina arrived in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean's busiest hurricane season on record. By season's end, 24 tropical storms had formed. Thirteen of these became hurricanes, including seven classified as major hurricanes, meaning they were category-3 or higher. In fact, 2005 saw a continuation of a trend that began in 1995. Since that year, tropical storm and hurricane activity in the Atlantic has been well above normal. An average of 7.7 hurricanes and 3.6 major hurricanes developed each year between 1995 and 2005, compared to an average of five hurricanes and 1.5 major hurricanes in each of the previous 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a recent study has shown a correlation between warmer ocean surface temperatures and more intense tropical storms and hurricanes, most experts say it's too early to tell how much of an effect global warming is having on the frequency and intensity of hurricanes. After all, periods of frequent tropical storms and hurricanes have happened before. On average, they have occurred every 25 years and lasted about as long, followed by equal periods of less-than-normal activity. Scientists say these cycles result from meteorological phenomena that have nothing to do with global warming. Still, most experts agree that if the current global warming trend continues it will both intensify the pattern already seen and increase the intensity of individual storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even if Atlantic hurricane frequency and intensity remain unchanged in the future, catastrophes like the one caused by Hurricane Katrina will likely become more common. The reason is simple: More people than ever before live in hurricane-prone areas of the United States. When Florida was hit by several powerful hurricanes in the 1940s and 50s, the devastation to human life and property was limited because so few people lived in vulnerable areas of the state. In contrast, Katrina left more than 1,300 people dead in Louisiana and Mississippi and caused at least several billion dollars' worth of property damage. The destruction could have been even worse. Before Katrina made landfall, its intensity dropped from category-5 status, with wind speeds greater than 249 km/hr (155 mph) to category-4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the role ocean currents have played in climate change, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.convey2/"&gt;Great Ocean Conveyor Belt: Part II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.convey/"&gt;Great Ocean Conveyor Belt: Part I&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about what happened when a Category 4 hurricane struck New Orleans, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.katrinawet/"&gt;Hurricane Katrina: Wetland Destruction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.katrinavid/"&gt;Hurricane Katrina: A Scientist's Response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;How has hurricane activity changed over the past century?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What evidence can be used to support the claim that the severity of Katrina was the result of global warming?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What lessons can be learned from this devastating natural event?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, local officials, including scientist Ivor Van Heerden, share their responses to Hurricane Katrina.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;The scenario had been predicted and the storm's path and intensity accurately forecast. Even so, when Hurricane Katrina struck, government agencies and residents alike seemed to be caught horribly off guard. In this video from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, correspondent Peter Standring returns to New Orleans a year after he spoke with experts about the threat a powerful hurricane posed for the city, to find out how their predictions played out when a big one actually did strike.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Roaring onto the Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 225 kilometers per hour (140 miles per hour), Hurricane Katrina dumped rain at a rate of more than 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) per hour for several hours and pushed a swell of ocean water more than 6 meters (20 feet) above normal along this vulnerable coastline.

      <annotation>Tour the wetlands south of New Orleans that were damaged by Hurricane Katrina in this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Wetlands along the southern coastlines of the United States serve as natural speed bumps to approaching hurricanes by starving them of warm ocean water and creating physical barriers to surging flood waters. However, in the last 100 years, the construction of levees and canals has turned thousands of square miles of wetland habitat into open water. This video from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; explores the importance of these critical habitats and examines the damage Hurricane Katrina caused to one stretch of Louisiana wetland.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Humans have been altering the natural environment to suit their needs for thousands of years. We've constructed shelter where none existed, planted food crops where forests once flourished, and in one of the more striking examples, built an entire city in the middle of a swamp. New Orleans, Louisiana, is a testament to the human will and ingenuity required to overcome seemingly impossible odds &amp;mdash; in a part of the world where a great deal of commerce stood to be gained. However, in August 2005, Hurricane Katrina tragically illustrated the potential consequences of defying the forces of nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Orleans sits in the middle of an ancient floodplain of the Mississippi River. Periodically, this mighty river, like most wild rivers, overflowed its banks, inundating the surrounding area. What was a natural and necessary occurrence for the wetland ecosystem of the Gulf coast threatened the viability of communities along the banks of the Mississippi. In response to this threat, people, as part of a government plan, began building a system of levees to heighten the river's banks and protect themselves from flooding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the centuries-old effort to control seasonal river flooding in New Orleans and other coastal cities has made the same communities increasingly vulnerable to ocean flooding from tropical storms and hurricanes. Wetlands along the Gulf coast provide the first line of defense against deadly hurricanes, by both limiting the storms' access to the warm open ocean water that drives them and by creating a physical barrier to the floodwaters, or storm surges, that they generate. Yet, coastal wetlands have been deteriorating and shrinking for decades because they no longer receive the influx of sediment and nutrients that periodic river flooding once provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom, or substrate, of coastal wetlands is unstable. It settles and sinks continuously. Without a steady supply of new sediment and nutrients, wetland plants soon become flooded themselves, causing expanses of open water to form. As a result of Mississippi River flood control, together with the opening of shipping channels that have caused saltwater to infiltrate freshwater wetlands, Louisiana has lost nearly 5180 square kilometers (2,000 square miles) of coastal wetlands, an area the size of the state of Delaware, in the last 70 years. As this trend continues, the likelihood that another hurricane will devastate the Gulf Coast region only increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how human-engineered changes have altered the Mississippi River system, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.missdelta/"&gt;The Mississippi River Delta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.flooderosion/"&gt;Flood: Farming and Erosion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about hurricanes and how they impact the Mississippi River Delta, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.neworleans/"&gt;Hurricanes: New Orleans Under Threat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.katrinavid/"&gt;Hurricane Katrina: A Scientist's Response&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.katrinadoc/"&gt;Hurricane Katrina: Possible Causes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how wetlands act as a buffer against the ocean's force when a hurricane approaches the coastline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do some people think it is important to rebuild the marshes that were damaged during Hurricane Katrina?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you think there should be restrictions on building in wetlands? Explain your reasoning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Why is water necessary for life? Why is it the best and possibly only liquid to do the job? This illustrated essay from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; answers these questions, explaining why planetary scientists are on the lookout for water elsewhere in the solar system.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Without liquid water, terrestrial life could not exist. All living organisms on Earth depend on water and its unique chemical and physical properties. In the search for life beyond Earth, scientists have focused their efforts on looking for signs of liquid water. This essay from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; explores why liquid water is considered an essential ingredient for life as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;To exist, life has three main requirements: chemical elements, a source of energy, and a medium that allows for chemical reactions to occur. The first two requirements are readily available throughout the universe. The third requirement causes more speculation -- what is an appropriate medium for the types of chemical reactions needed to create and sustain life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Earth, liquid water is the essential medium. But some scientists speculate that liquid water is not the only solvent that could sustain life. For example, perhaps liquid ammonia could fulfill the role of water. In our solar system, liquid ammonia is common, and it is similar to water as a solvent. However, it would be difficult for life to survive in an ammonia environment because the temperature range in which this chemical exists as a liquid -- -78&amp;deg;C to -33&amp;deg;C (-108&amp;deg;F to -27&amp;deg;F) -- is very narrow and very cold. At such low temperatures, chemical reactions happen incredibly slowly, which makes it unlikely for life to arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, The National Academy of Sciences organized a group of scientists to address the question of the limits of organic life of planetary systems. Rather than restrict the search for life to carbon and water-based organisms, the committee is evaluating the possibility of "weird life." When stretched beyond the rules of standard biology, the search for extraterrestrial life opens up. Thus, without the restriction of liquid water, even the jovian planets -- the four gas giants within Earth's solar system: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune -- could potentially provide a habitable environment for unusual life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best candidates for unusual life is Saturn's moon, Titan. In January 2005, the Huygens probe landed on Titan and found strong evidence of methane rain and seas. Liquid hydrocarbons such as methane cannot dissolve DNA, the genetic material for all life on Earth, but they are good solvents that can support complex chemical reactions. If life were to survive in a methane environment, it would be an entirely unfamiliar form of life -- one without DNA. Waterless life is not impossible, but it has yet to be found. The challenge in searching for life that is completely different from what we know is that we have no idea what to look for!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the carbon-based life, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.carbon/"&gt;Ingredients for Life: Carbon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the importance of water, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.lifeessential/"&gt;Life's Little Essential: Liquid Water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about water on Mars, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.upclose/"&gt;Mars Dead or Alive: Mars Up Close&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the search for life on Mars, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.hostenviron/"&gt;Mars Dead or Alive: A Hostile Environment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the argument in favor of the idea that liquid water is essential to life? What other substances have been proposed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you think life could have gotten started without water?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is it important that solid water (ice) floats rather than sinks?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is it possible for all three states of water to coexist on Earth at the same time?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do planetary scientists search for evidence of liquid water on other planets?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;On average, the tropics receive more solar radiation annually than zones located at higher latitudes. But solar radiation is only one of several variables that determine the mean annual temperature of a given region. For example, Quito, Ecuador is on average 10&amp;deg;C (18&amp;deg;F) cooler than Miami, Florida, despite sitting much closer to the equator. The main reason for this discrepancy is elevation. While Quito sits 2,800 meters (9,200 feet) above sea level in the Andes Mountains, Miami is a mere 3 meters (9 feet) above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuador is located on the west coast of South America. This means that the Pacific Ocean lies to the west and the Amazon rainforest lies to the east, allowing the prevailing winds to pick up moisture from whichever direction they are blowing. These moisture-laden air masses are then driven upward by the slopes of the Ecuadorian Andes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rising air mass experiences decreasing atmospheric pressure the higher in altitude it goes. This decrease in pressure allows the air mass to expand, which in turn causes it to cool. On average, air temperature decreases 10&amp;deg;C for every 1,000-meter (18&amp;deg;F for every 3,280-foot) increase in altitude. This cooling also results in precipitation. If an air mass continues to rise, it eventually cools to its condensation temperature and forms clouds. When water droplets become large enough, they fall to Earth as precipitation. This example demonstrates how topography, moisture sources, and air masses interact with solar radiation to create local climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Earth's major biomes &amp;mdash; areas with similar climate and plant and animal life &amp;mdash; check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.biomemap/"&gt;Biomes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.reg.deathvall/"&gt;Teri and Jairus: Biome Buddies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Mountains can be awe-inspiring both for the vistas they provide and for the weather events and long-term climate systems they support. This interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; illustrates how a moisture-laden air mass interacts with a mountain slope to produce characteristic patterns of precipitation over the mountain and surrounding areas.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <annotation>In this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; you can move an air mass over a mountain and see how several distinct microclimates are created.</annotation>

Explain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you walk up the mountain, will your ears pop because of the pressure? Explain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe why a decrease in air pressure causes air to cool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe why the windward side of a mountain is usually wetter than the leeward side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, climbers attempting to reach Mount Everest's summit must contend with the low levels of oxygen at high altitudes.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;At high altitudes, Earth's atmosphere is much thinner than it is at sea level. Mountain climbers trying to reach the highest peaks have to overcome a lack of oxygen. Mount Everest, the highest point in the world, seems to be at the limit of human capabilities. In this video segment adapted from NOVA, learn about how climbers ascending Mount Everest combat mountain sickness.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;On Earth, all life exists in the troposphere -- the lowest and densest layer of the atmosphere, composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases. Nearly all organisms require oxygen to survive; humans rely on the oxygen in every breath of air that enters their lungs. The chemical composition of the troposphere is fairly uniform, so it might seem that humans should be able survive at any elevation. However, as altitude increases and atmospheric pressure decreases, there is less oxygen available in each breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earth's gravity pulls on the gas molecules in air, creating atmospheric pressure. Air that is closer to the ground is compressed by the weight of all the air above it. At sea level, the weight of air on one square-inch of area is about 14.7 pounds. At higher altitudes, there is less pressure because less air is pushing down from above. Less atmospheric pressure means that the density of the air is lower. With fewer air molecules in a given volume of space, there are fewer oxygen molecules available, even though the air is still 21% oxygen. For mountain climbers at extreme altitudes, such as at the top of Mount Everest where the air is only about one-third as dense as the air at sea level, it is a challenge to be able to get enough oxygen in each breath. The decreased atmospheric pressure and low levels of oxygen can have very dangerous effects on a climber's body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though there is less oxygen available to the climbers, their bodies can learn to compensate. The human body survives by breathing air into lungs. The oxygen from the air is transferred from the lungs to the blood, which then transports it throughout the body. Mountain climbers' bodies can adjust to high-altitude air in several ways, such as increasing the frequency of breathing and increasing blood flow. However, if climbers do not allow enough time for their bodies to acclimatize, or if the air is simply too thin, they may suffer from high-altitude sickness. At a towering height of about 8,800 meters (29,000 feet), Mount Everest seems to be at the limit at which the human body can survive. Most climbers cannot reach the summit of Everest without the help of supplementary oxygen, though there have been a few extraordinary individuals whose bodies have been able to successfully adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Earth's atmosphere, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.pressure/"&gt;Atmospheric Pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how the human body reacts to high altitudes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.stru.bodybreak/"&gt;Body Breakdowns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about why oxygen is important for life, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.oate.oxygen/"&gt;Atmospheric Oxygen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about challenges of mountain climbing, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.mountemp/"&gt;Mountain Weather: A Climber's Story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determine how effectively common clothing fabrics insulate against cold in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2702_everest.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What happens to the oxygen as you go higher in altitude? What is it like five miles above sea level?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is hypoxia and what are its symptoms? Is it dangerous?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does the hyperbaric chamber (Gamoff bag) work to help alleviate symptoms of hypoxia?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do humans attempt to climb Mount Everest even though it is so dangerous?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you imagine wanting to climb Mount Everest yourself?

      <annotation>In this interactive world map from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; explore nine key tsunamis dating from 3.5 billion years ago and discover what experts have learned from studying them.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Long before the devastating December 2004 Indian Ocean event, tsunamis had already been implicated in the widespread death and destruction in Java and Sumatra following the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. Tsunamis are also blamed for the collapse of the ancient Minoan civilization on Crete. These energy-charged series of waves are capable of overrunning almost any coastline in the world and exacting a serious toll on both property and life. In this interactive world map from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt;, you can explore key tsunamis dating from 3.5 billion years ago, along with a hypothesized future event.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Just as scientists cannot predict precisely when earthquakes or volcanic events will occur, neither can they determine exactly when a tsunami will be generated. However, by studying past tsunamis, scientists can predict where they are most likely to occur in the future and what their impact on specific coastal locations is likely to be. Using physical evidence and, where available, eyewitness accounts, geologists work to piece together entire tsunami histories, beginning with the causal event and ending with the aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From numerous studies, scientists know that not all underwater or near-shore seismic events cause tsunamis. To generate a tsunami, an earthquake -- the most commonly cited cause of tsunamis -- must be very large and centered at depths no greater than 50 kilometers (30 mi). About 85 percent of all recorded tsunamis originated in the Pacific Ocean, which is replete with faults, and scientists can create prediction models based on known subduction zones that fit the profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to earthquakes, volcanoes may also initiate tsunamis. Violent eruptions or massive slope failures can result in the displacement of the large volumes of water needed to trigger a tsunami. Although less frequently than volcanic events, rock falls and submarine landslides may also produce tsunami waves. Sudden slope failures like these are sometimes triggered by strong earthquakes. Although evidence suggests that wave energy generated by point-source events such as landslides tends to dissipate quickly, historical events in Japan, Alaska, and elsewhere demonstrate that the local effects of tsunamis caused by these sources can be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In areas where tsunamis have occurred in the last several hundred years, eyewitness reports or written accounts sometimes provide scientists with the information needed to gauge the potential impact of future tsunamis in the same area. In such cases, scientists seek to learn how many waves came ashore, how high they were, which one was the biggest, and how far the tsunami moved inland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When no human documentation exists, geologists rely on the fact that tsunamis erode, transport, and deposit sediments. For example, the presence of sand or gravel deposits normally found on a coastline in an inland location might indicate that a tsunami transported the material. Thicker deposits suggest larger waves because larger waves are capable of carrying more sediment from the seafloor. Also, the discovery of flattened plants entombed in a layer of sand suggests that powerful waves rolled quickly in and out of an area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how tsunamis form and what makes them such a devastating force of nature, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.anatomytsunami/"&gt;Anatomy of a Tsunami&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about tsunami warning systems and the detection technologies they rely on, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.wavefuture/"&gt;Wave of the Future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; uses animation and graphics to offer a detailed explanation of the jet stream. A thorough account is given of the role played by the Sun's heat and Earth's shape and rotation, among other factors.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;The high-speed winds of jet streams, found near the top of the troposphere, play a major role in guiding weather systems. Many factors, including Earth's rotation and the Sun's uneven heating of Earth's surface, contribute to the formation of the powerful eastward flows of the jet streams. In this interactive resource from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt;, learn about the factors that create these powerful meteorological forces.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Nearly all forms of weather, including Earth's most powerful winds, can be attributed to the fact that the Sun warms our planet unevenly. Because of the angle at which solar radiation strikes Earth's surface, regions near the equator are heated more intensely than those near the poles. This results in areas of relatively warm air near the equator and areas of relatively cool air near the poles. Warm air is less dense than cold air, and these density differences create air pressure differences from region to region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air moves horizontally from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure. This movement creates wind. The greater the pressure difference, the stronger the wind blows. Moving upward into the atmosphere, the air thins, and the pressure difference between warm and cold air increases. Thus, the fastest winds occur at high altitudes where pressure differences are greatest, rather than at Earth's surface. These high altitudes are where the high-speed jet streams travel. In addition, air flowing towards areas of lower pressure is deflected toward the east by Earth's rotation. This deflection affects wind direction, so that air generally moves from west to east around Earth, as seen in the flow of jet streams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most extreme temperature and pressure gradients is found at the polar front, where consistently cold polar air meets consistently warm sub-tropical air. This boundary of differences gives rise to the polar front jet stream, a high-speed band of wind traveling at up to 400 kilometers per hour (249 miles per hour) that encircles Earth at altitudes of 10-15 kilometers (6-9 miles). Sometimes it meanders wildly southward or northward, but in the northern hemisphere generally it moves from west to east. The jet stream moves in sweeping loops thousands of kilometers long, hundreds of kilometers wide, and two to three kilometers (one to two miles) thick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The polar front jet stream is instrumental in both creating and moving storms over the United States. The fastest winds within a jet stream, called jet streaks, can induce horizontal pressure differences at the surface that initiate mid-latitude storms. These storms track across the country guided by the jet stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about conditions that create the jet stream, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.viewjet/"&gt;A Five-Day View of the Jet Stream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.jetstream/"&gt;The Jet Stream and Horizontal Temperature Gradients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about important weather patterns that relate to jet streams, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/mck05.sci.ess.watcyc.fronts/"&gt;Compare and Contrast Warm and Cold Fronts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.weather/"&gt;Global Weather Machine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The animation describes how warm tropical air is "drawn toward the cold North and South poles." Can you explain why this is so?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think the warm tropical air sinks when it reaches the poles?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does Earth's rotation affect the direction of the jet streams?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does the jet stream affect the weather where you live?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; uses microwave images to reveal how sea ice doubles the size of Antarctica each winter. Rare footage shows how sea ice crushed the famous ship &lt;em&gt;Endurance&lt;/em&gt; in 1914.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Each winter, the ice apron that surrounds the continent of Antarctica expands from its summertime area of about 4 million square kilometers (1.5 million sq mi) to 20 million square kilometers (7.5 million sq mi). Although its presence has proven treacherous for would-be explorers and commercial shippers, sea ice provides essential hunting, feeding, and breeding habitats to polar bears, seals, and penguins. It also helps regulate temperature, moisture, and ocean salinity worldwide. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn how sea ice forms and how its seasonal fluctuation dramatically changes the continent of Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Three percent of Earth's water exists as ice &amp;mdash; most of it locked up in glacial formations. This ice, together with the seasonal sea ice that forms in the polar regions where temperatures remain below freezing year-round, helps to regulate temperature, moisture, and ocean salinity worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, seawater contains 35% salt, so it freezes at a slightly lower temperature (-2&amp;deg;C or 28&amp;deg;F) than pure water does. When sea ice forms, the frozen water floats above the denser ocean water, and the salt falls out of solution into the sea below. As the water begins to freeze, chunks of frazil ice form and collide with one another. Frazil ice is composed of small, spiky ice crystals and plates suspended in the water. The surface gradually takes on a greasy appearance before forming a solid ice cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Arctic Ocean, extremely thick ice forms because land surrounds most of the Arctic Ocean and creates a relatively calm setting for ice formation. In contrast, sea ice surrounding the Antarctic continent typically grows no more than a few meters thick. High winds and strong currents produce restless seas around the large landmass, and the ice tends to break up before it can thicken. Antarctic sea ice is known as seasonal ice because it forms and melts as the polar seasons change from winter to summer. In the Arctic, the seasonal fluctuation of sea ice is much less than in Antarctica. Sea ice that remains year-round is called perennial ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data generated from satellite monitoring of polar ice formation indicate that sea ice coverage and thickness have decreased in both the Arctic and Antarctic over the past three decades. Although Antarctic sea ice has rebounded since a dramatic reduction in volume in the 1970s, the recent loss rate of Arctic sea ice &amp;mdash; 8 percent per decade &amp;mdash; is such that it could completely disappear by the end of this century. Even small changes in ice volume could have a significant impact on global climate, ocean circulation patterns, and polar animal habitats; such a dramatic change in ice volume would likely have an even more dramatic impact on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain the decline in sea ice, scientists have proposed several potential causes, including global warming accelerated by fossil fuel consumption; the effects of pollution, specifically the increased absorption of sunlight due to the accumulation of black carbon soot; and natural climatic variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the important roles that ice plays in moderating global temperature and ocean circulation, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.esglaciers/"&gt;Earth System: Ice and Global Warming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how water is circulated in the world's oceans, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.convey/"&gt;Great Ocean Conveyor Belt: Part I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.convey2/"&gt;Great Ocean Conveyor Belt: Part II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how glacial melting might affect global sea level, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.icemelt/"&gt;Mountain of Ice: If the Ice Melts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>What would happen if a portion of the Antarctic Ice Sheet were to melt? This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; uses animations to show the effect of a 6-meter sea-level rise on coastal cities across the world.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In 1995 and again in 2002, large fragments of the Larsen Ice Shelf sheared away from Antarctica's West Ice Sheet. In the second event, an area the size of Rhode Island collapsed from the sheet. Although these dramatic events did not add to the modest 8-cm rise in global sea level experienced over the past 50 years, much of the predicted 25-cm (or greater) rise in the next century may result from the incremental melting and growing instability of the world's glaciers. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn what might happen to the global sea level if atmospheric warming precipitated the collapse of Antarctica's West Sheet.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;As has been widely reported in the media, massive icebergs have sheared off Antarctica's West Ice Sheet in recent years. An iceberg forms when a large chunk of ice breaks free, or calves, from an ice shelf -- a floating extension of a landed ice sheet. As with an ice cube floating in a glass of water, an iceberg displaces the same volume of water that it contains. So, if it were to melt, the sea level would stay exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that sea ice doesn't affect sea level when it melts doesn't mean that the breakup of an ice shelf is inconsequential. An ice shelf acts as a buttress that prevents a landed ice sheet -- whose melting &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; cause sea level to rise -- from sliding into the sea and increasing the volume of water. In fact, if you divided the volume of the water frozen in the entire West Sheet by the total surface area of the seas in which it would melt, you would determine that its demise would raise the global sea level by as much as 6 meters. It is estimated that a sea-level rise of less than half a meter would inundate up to 300 meters of seashore, and that such flooding would displace millions of people in coastal cities and low-lying islands worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising global temperatures are thought to be responsible for accelerated glacial movement. Climate records over the past 50 years show that air temperatures have increased 2.5&amp;deg;C in the Antarctic Peninsula, which juts off the West Sheet. This is about five times greater than warming measured for the rest of the world. Other evidence, such as the increased incidence of ice stream formation, corroborates the proposed connection between increased temperatures and decreased ice in Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the observed Larsen Ice Shelf collapse in 2002, measurements of glacial movement on the West Sheet indicate that some glaciers are moving eight times as fast as before this breakup, dumping nearly 25 cubic kilometers more ice into the ocean each year. These results demonstrate that not all parts of the globe respond to increased temperatures equally, and that the ice-covered regions of the Antarctic appear to be particularly sensitive to even small changes in global temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about fast-moving ice streams, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.icestreams/"&gt;Antarctic Ice Movement: Part II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how glacial melting might affect global sea level, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.icemelt/"&gt;Mountain of Ice: If the Ice Melts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the important roles that ice plays in moderating global temperature and ocean circulation, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.esglaciers/"&gt;Earth System: Ice and Global Warming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt;, use the Fujita tornado intensity scale to assess the level of destruction left in the wake of actual tornadoes.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;The whirling winds of tornadoes can produce damage that ranges from broken tree limbs to a block of houses swept from their foundations. They can inflict utter devastation across a wide swath of land or, remarkably, destroy one house and leave others on either side largely untouched. In this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt;, you will evaluate scenes of destruction utilizing the most widely used scale for assessing a tornado's intensity, the Fujita scale.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to take direct measurements of tornadoes due to their unpredictable behavior. In the 1970s, meteorologist Ted Fujita proposed a scale to classify a tornado's intensity. The scale gauged the tornado's maximum wind speed according to the maximum damage that it inflicted. The Fujita scale, or F-scale, has six ratings ranging from F0 to F5. F0 tornadoes have weak winds that inflict light damage. Powerful F5 tornadoes can strip the bark from trees or tear whole houses from their foundations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One problem with a scale that associates damage with wind speed is that two tornadoes with different wind speeds can cause similar damage. Likewise, two tornadoes with the same wind speeds can cause different levels of damage. Factors including differences in building construction, wind direction, and wind duration may account for this variability. Moreover, the process of rating the damage itself is largely subjective. Two highly experienced damage surveyors may assign different F-scale ratings for the same disaster scene. In spite of its shortcomings, however, the F-scale continues to be the most widely used method for rating tornado damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, new technologies have improved the accuracy of weather predictions. Using Doppler radar, forecasters can now spot the large-scale rotation from which many tornadoes form and measure the strength of the vortex by tracking raindrops carried inside a developing tornado. In an effort to reduce tornado-related casualties, the National Weather Service (NWS) now issues tornado watches and warnings over local radio and television broadcasts as soon as tornadoes are indicated on weather radar or spotted from the ground -- before they actually strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the high death, injury, and property damage tolls from tornadoes have prompted some structural engineers to look at ways to construct tornado-safe buildings and houses. Research has shown that a tornado exerts an upward force on a structure up to 10 times stronger than the force of gravity. This can tear a roof from its supporting walls and lead to complete structural collapse. It also appears that the dimensions of a structure can alter a tornado's path, causing the twister to veer to one side. By understanding how tornadoes interact with structures, engineers hope to design or modify buildings accordingly to minimize tornado damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about forecasting tornadoes, including the characteristic hook shape that projects from the center of storms on radar, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.chasing/"&gt;Chasing Tornadoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To view drive-by footage of tornado devastation in an Oklahoma town and better understand the fleeting nature of tornadoes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.tornkansas/"&gt;Tornado Chaser Footage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a map of the U.S., mark the location of each tornado as you work through the activity. What do you observe about the location and severity of the tornadoes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What evidence do you see in each photograph to support your choice of tornado intensity?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tornadoes can have vastly different effects in the same area. Why might they strike one place and not another?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What characteristics would you look for in a house that could resist a tornado?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are one or two ways a person might protect him- or herself from a tornado?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you think scientists learn from rating tornado damage?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider whether the Fujita rating system for tornadoes is appropriate in all areas and for all tornadoes. What might be some problems in using the system?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This animation from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; lets you examine a five-day view of the jet stream.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Although few weather phenomena have the ability to affect weather on a global scale, the jet streams are one such phenomenon. These bands of high-speed wind roar through the atmosphere 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 10 miles) above Earth's surface. This animated image from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; illustrates a jet stream's wild undulations over North America during a five-day period in January 2001.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered how weather can change from clear and 20&amp;deg;C (68&amp;deg;F) one day to snow and freezing temperatures the next? Invariably, such dramatic changes in weather are linked to changes in the position of the polar-front jet stream. This high-speed band of wind travels up to 400 kilometers per hour (250 miles per hour) and encircles Earth in great curving arcs at altitudes of 10-15 kilometers (6-9 miles). Locations north of the jet stream are colder than locations south of it. The jet stream moves in sweeping loops thousands of kilometers long, hundreds of kilometers wide, and two to three kilometers (one to two miles) thick. As it moves, it steers the paths of storm systems around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the Earth's tilt, some areas of Earth's surface receive more solar radiation than others and grow warmer. The amount of heat conducted back up into the atmosphere over a given region also varies, and both of these phenomena result in areas of warmer and cooler air. Warm air is less dense than cold air, and these density differences create air pressure differences from region to region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air moves horizontally from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure. This movement creates wind. The greater the pressure difference, the stronger the wind blows. Moving upward into the atmosphere, the air thins, and the pressure difference between warm and cold air increases. Thus, the fastest winds occur at high altitudes where pressure differences are greatest, rather than at Earth's surface. These high altitudes are where the high-speed polar-front jet stream travels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air flowing towards areas of lower pressure is deflected toward the east by Earth's rotation. This deflection affects wind direction, which is represented by the red flags in the animation. The red flags point in the direction the wind is moving, generally west to east. At the end of the animation, along the East Coast, winds are generally moving southwest to northeast. The polar-front jet stream, represented by blue ribbons in the animation, transverses the U.S. from west to east.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about conditions that create the jet stream, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.risejet/"&gt;Giving Rise to the Jet Stream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.jetstream/"&gt;The Jet Stream and Horizontal Temperature Gradients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about important weather patterns that relate to jet streams, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/mck05.sci.ess.watcyc.fronts/"&gt;Compare and Contrast Warm and Cold Fronts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.weather/"&gt;Global Weather Machine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

Explain why.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What impact do you think the jet stream will have on Florida during the five days simulated here?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will the jet stream pattern change in July?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This media-rich essay from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; describes the challenges involved in installing a warning system for tsunamis in the Indian Ocean.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Tsunamis are the result of processes that shape the Earth's surface: earthquakes, volcanic events, and landslides. People cannot control the dynamic forces that drive tectonic events. Nor can they prevent most of the physical devastation they impart. However, people can reduce the number of lives lost to tsunamis by using technology to assess hazards, develop warning systems, and educate the public. This media-rich essay from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; discusses what it will take to implement an effective tsunami warning system so that the major toll inflicted on December 26, 2004 will not be experienced again.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The undersea earthquake that struck 160 kilometers (100 mi) west of Sumatra in December 2004 was more powerful than all of the world's earthquakes over the last five years combined. The magnitude 9.0 to 9.3 event, which shifted the entire planet, spawned a tsunami that killed as many as 300,000 people and displaced more than 1.5 million people living near the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of those who were killed, especially in places far from the earthquake's epicenter, might have been saved if a comprehensive tsunami warning system had been operating in the Indian Ocean. With 600 million or more people across the globe predicted to be living within 100 kilometers (62 mi) of coastlines by 2025, setting up effective tsunami warning systems in all the world's oceans is a critical task. Still, there are challenges, including technological limitations, fiscal constraints, and the bureaucratic red tape that hinders international cooperation and communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A warning system comprised of a seismic detection system, a tide gauge system, and a communications system has been in place in the Pacific Ocean since 1948, and it provides a model for an Indian Ocean system. The Pacific system has accurately detected every major tsunami since its installation. New sea-floor sensors, designed to monitor pressure changes in the water above them, were installed in 2002 to help reduce the high false-alarm rate (75 percent). The cost of implementing a system with similar instrumentation in the Indian Ocean would be between US$250 million and US$400 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about warning systems for another kind of natural disaster, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.tornado/"&gt;Rate Tornado Damage&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how tsunamis form and what makes them such a devastating force of nature, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.anatomytsunami/"&gt;Anatomy of a Tsunami&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about what studies of tsunamis through history can tell us about possible future events, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.oncetsunami/"&gt;Once and Future Tsunamis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe how the Pacific warning system "works".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why didn't the scientists who knew that an earthquake had occurred in the Indonesian area send out warnings about a possible tsunami?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are nature's three tsunami warning signs?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A British girl vacationing in Thailand saved lives because she knew what the retreating water that preceded the tsunami meant. What does this say about tsunami education in regions where they may occur?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tsunami warning systems are expensive. What criteria do you think decision-makers should use in deciding whether to invest in such a warning system in oceans throughout the world?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this illustrated essay from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt;, explore the cyclical process of weather creation and the effects of El Ni&amp;ntilde;o on the global weather system.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this media-enhanced essay from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt;, you can learn about the atmospheric conditions that drive weather on Earth. A complex interplay of heat, air, and water generates wind and related manifestations that ensure that no two days will ever have the same weather.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;El Ni&amp;ntilde;o events are among the most studied of Earth's weather phenomena. Though their origins may be particular to tropical latitudes, they can shape climate on a global scale. To understand this anomaly, it may be helpful to review what normally drives weather cycles in tropical latitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, high pressure predominates over the eastern Pacific Ocean and low pressure over the western Pacific Ocean. Denser, cooler air rushes in to fill low-pressure voids left by rising warm air, producing trade winds and a corresponding current of water that move from east to west between South America and Australia. The flowing surface water, which is warmed by the heat of the Sun to a depth of about 90 meters (300 feet), raises sea level in the western Pacific by about 40 centimeters (16 inches). To equalize the loss of water in the east, cooler water rises from the depths to the surface near the South American coast, bringing with it nutrients that attract fish stocks like anchovies, an important staple in the global fish supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around late December each year, a warm ocean current flows south along the coasts of Ecuador and Peru. In some years, that current is warmer and stronger, and it flows farther than usual. At the same time, heavy rains fall in normally dry areas along the coasts of North, Central, and South America. These unusual conditions, called El Ni&amp;ntilde;o because they occur during the Christmas season, are thought to be caused by a slackening, and then a complete reversal, of the normal wind patterns and ocean currents. When trade winds weaken, they can no longer buttress the additional mass of warm water in the west, warmed now to a depth of 150 meters (500 feet), so it surges back eastward due to the force of gravity. The winds change direction, and all of the rainmaking that normally happens in the west now happens in the east. The deeper pool of warm water blocks the normal upwelling of nutrients, thus also devastating fish stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a period of months, or as much as a year or more, the Pacific waters cool and conditions return to normal. More frequently, however, the conditions turn to the opposite extreme. All the warm surface water that moved east returns west as abnormally cold water. This reversal is called La Ni&amp;ntilde;a. Scientists cannot be certain of the precise cause of El Ni&amp;ntilde;o events, but the documented increase in the frequency and power of these events has led some to look for a connection with global warming, and in particular whether or not accumulating greenhouse gases are overheating Pacific waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about global winds, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.risejet/"&gt;Giving Rise to the Jet Stream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the distribution of global rainfall, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.rainfall/"&gt;20-Year Map of Global Rainfall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the El Ni&amp;ntilde;o phenomenon and its wide-reaching effects, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.eselnino/"&gt;Earth System: El Niño&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how ocean temperatures, air pressure, and winds create the conditions for El Ni&amp;ntilde;os, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.oceancur/"&gt;Ocean Temperatures and Climate Patterns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Give an example of how the heat of the Sun drives weather.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In this media-enhanced essay, what is meant by the statement: "The unrelenting march of this energy-on-the-move, from high concentration to low concentration, is the piston in the engine that propels weather."?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how a large mass of warm water, such as the one that develops in the Pacific, can have such a dramatic effect on the weather of nearby land masses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;El Ni&amp;ntilde;o disrupts the normal weather pattern of continents surrounding the Pacific Ocean. Describe the normal pattern and the El Ni&amp;ntilde;o pattern of those affected areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design a demonstration to show convection in fluids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;: "Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial," learn about the discovery of a well-preserved transitional fossil and how such transitional fossils support the theory of evolution.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;: "Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial," paleontologist Neil Shubin recounts a fossil discovery that added another compelling piece to the body of evidence that supports evolution. Shubin's find of a well-preserved skeleton, a "fishapod," represents a transitional fossil. Transitional fossils help scientists bridge gaps in the tree of life, resulting in a picture of gradual evolution over millions of years. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; According to modern evolutionary theory, all populations of organisms are in transition. A "transitional form" is a species that is intermediate between two different species. However, due to the special circumstances required for preservation of living things, only a very small percentage of all life forms that ever have existed will have their remains unearthed for study. Earth's crust is continually being recycled, so fossils that may be contained in various rock layers get destroyed through natural processes. What's more, many potential fossil hiding grounds are inaccessible, for example, those deep undersea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nevertheless, scientists have uncovered enough fossils to illustrate many important evolutionary transitions. In this video, we learn about one recent find&amp;mdash;the skeletal remains of a part-fish, part-tetrapod, or "fishapod"&amp;mdash;that represents an intermediate form between fish with fins and land animals with four limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiktaalik&lt;/em&gt;, from the Inuit word meaning "large shallow-water fish," had a flexible neck. This is significant because in modern tetrapods like amphibians, the head is separated from the body, whereas in fish it is not. Although &lt;em&gt;Tiktaalik&lt;/em&gt; still had gills, it had lost the bony gill coverings that fish use to fan water and promote oxygen intake. This suggests that the "fishapod" may have been at least partly air-breathing, like modern tetrapods. Further, although &lt;em&gt;Tiktaalik&lt;/em&gt; clearly had fins, the well-preserved bony, wrist-like arrangements near the tips of the fins suggested that the animal could push its body up off the ground, offering support much like a foot does. These fins, though still used for swimming, were clearly precursors to legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This important find reinforces the idea that the move from water to land was a very gradual process, and the evolution of limbs was neither a simple nor spontaneous adaptation. In fact, the new picture of this transition shows that most of the changes needed for life on dry land happened in creatures that were still living in the water. &lt;em&gt;Tiktaalik&lt;/em&gt; illustrates yet another important evolutionary transition, much like the primitive bird &lt;em&gt;Archaeopteryx&lt;/em&gt; links reptiles and birds, the "walking whale" &lt;em&gt;Ambulocetus&lt;/em&gt; links land mammals to aquatic mammals, and hominids, including &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt;, link apes to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about what scientists mean by "theory," check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/evol07.sci.life.gen.theorydef/"&gt;What Is a Theory?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about evolutionary relationships, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.allinthefamily/"&gt;All in the Family&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.ess.earthsys.deeptime/"&gt;Deep Time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the fossilization process, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.fossilintro/"&gt;How a Dinosaur Became a Fossil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.fossilcollage/"&gt;Fossils&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the discovery of other transitional forms, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.daeschshub/"&gt;Ted Daeschler and Neil Shubin: Early Tetrapod Fossils&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.howhappens/"&gt;Evolving Ideas: How Do We Know Evolution Happens?&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.fishfingers/"&gt;Fish with Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.whalesinmaking/"&gt;Whales in the Making&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did Shubin and his colleagues select the dig site where they ultimately found the "fishapod" fossil? Why did they have to go to the Canadian Arctic to excavate rocks that are about 375 million years old? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is a tetrapod? Can you name examples of tetrapods living today? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What about &lt;em&gt;Tiktaalik&lt;/em&gt; suggests that the animal had characteristics of fish? What suggests it had characteristics of amphibians? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is meant by the term "transitional" fossil? Can you provide another example of a transitional fossil and how it transitions from one life form to another? What characteristics are shared between the two life forms? How does this fossil support Darwin's idea of common ancestry? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;: "Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial," learn how modern genetics and molecular biology offer compelling support for evolution. The video features an interview with biologist Ken Miller.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;: "Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial" reveals how genetic evidence helped to confirm an important component of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection: the common ancestry of humans and apes. In particular, it explains that humans have one fewer chromosome pair in their cells than apes, due to a mutation found in chromosome number 2 that caused two chromosomes to fuse into one. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; Since the mid-1800s, biologists have generally shared the belief that all living things descended from a single common ancestor. Based on fossil evidence and comparative anatomy, Charles Darwin proposed that humans and great apes&amp;mdash;which include chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans&amp;mdash;share a common ancestor that lived several million years ago. More recent research has propped up Darwin's theory of common descent (also called common ancestry): genome analysis reveals the genetic difference between humans and chimps to be less than 2 percent. In other words, humans and chimps have DNA sequences that are greater than 98 percent similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the genetic similarity between human and ape strengthened Darwin's theory, a significant, unexplained discrepancy remained. While great apes all have 48 chromosomes (24 pairs), humans have only 46 (23 pairs). If humans and apes shared a common ancestor, shouldn't both have the same number of chromosomes in their cells?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The phases through which chromosomes replicate, divide, shuffle, and recombine are imperfect, as DNA is subject to random mutations. Mutations do not always produce harmful outcomes. In fact, many mutations are thought to be neutral, and some even give rise to beneficial traits. To corroborate Darwin's theory, scientists would need to find a valid explanation for why a chromosome pair is missing in humans that is present in apes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fundamental part of the process by which science is done involves developing a testable prediction, also known as a hypothesis. Scientists offered two possible explanations for the discrepancy: Either the common ancestor had 24 pairs, and humans carry a fused chromosome; or the ancestor had 23 pairs, and apes carry a split chromosome. Their focused research led them to find a mutation on one human chromosome that explained what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2005, a peer-reviewed scientific journal published results of the tests. It turns out that chromosome 2, which is unique to the human lineage of evolution, emerged as a result of the head-to-head fusion of two ancestral chromosomes that remain separate in other primates. Three genetic indicators provide strong, if not conclusive, evidence of fusion. First, the banding (or dye pattern) of human chromosome 2 closely matches that of two separate chromosomes found in apes (chimp chromosome 2 and an extra chromosome that does not match any other human chromosome). Second, a chromosome normally has one centromere, or central point at which a chromosome's two identical strands are joined. Yet remnants of a second, presumably inactive centromere can be found on human chromosome 2. And third, whereas a normal chromosome has readily identifiable, repeating DNA sequences called telomeres at both ends, chromosome 2 also has telomere sequences not only at both ends but also in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about fossil and molecular evidence that supports common ancestry, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.humev/"&gt;Evolving Ideas: Did Humans Evolve?&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is a chromosome? Do all animals share the same number of chromosomes in their cells? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the significance of chromosome 2 in human evolution? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is a telomere? What is a centromere? How were these used to prove humans' common ancestry with apes? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you find the interpretation of chromosome 2 convincing evidence that humans share a common ancestry with other great apes? Explain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In these two audio interviews from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt;, learn about the difference between the common understanding of the word "theory" and how science uses the term.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In these audio interviews from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt;, Barbara Forrest, a philosophy professor, and paleontologist Kevin Padian address the basis of a general misunderstanding of what a scientific theory is. Although it may be defined as just a hunch in everyday language, a theory in science is an explanation strengthened by a large body of evidence. Theories including evolution theory, germ theory, and gravitation theory have stood the test of time in the face of rigorous testing, evaluation, and revision. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; In science, theories bring together a large body of observations, natural laws, hypotheses, and inferences into coherent, well-supported, and testable explanations that help us make sense of the world in which we live. From a scientist's perspective, facts and theories are not mere components of a hierarchy of certainty. Facts are observations, and theories are structures of ideas that explain observations. In a very real way, then, a theory holds considerably more weight than just a fact does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the study of life forms, facts include fossils, their locations, and their measurements. Theories may be proposed to explain these facts. In describing his life's work, Charles Darwin cited two distinct accomplishments: establishing the fact of evolution, and proposing a theory to explain its mechanism, natural selection. That living things have evolved over time is a fact, supported by a wide body of evidence&amp;mdash;the fossil record. But there are various theories concerning the mechanism of evolution, evolution by natural selection being one such theory that has stood the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But rather than being conclusive and absolute, scientific theories are tentative. With new discoveries and experimental techniques, scientific theories are refined. Because scientific theories are not absolute, they invite critical analysis and direct new research. It is through testing and re-testing that a theory's central supposition may be strengthened, or even discredited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take this example from history. Before the 16th century, the traditional view of the universe was adopted from the ideas of the ancient Greek astronomer, geographer, and mathematician Ptolemy. That is, for 1400 years, people generally believed that Earth was the center of the universe and that all other celestial bodies revolved around it. However, before his death in 1543, Copernicus proposed a rival idea: that of a Sun-centered universe. Working in the early 1600s, Galileo sought to inquire if Copernicus had it right. Using a relatively new technology, a telescope, Galileo was able to gather quantitative evidence in support of the Copernican theory. He found many facts that contradicted the geocentric view, including that Jupiter had satellites orbiting it, and that Venus was orbiting the Sun. Through his guided research and careful observations, Galileo recorded evidence that would eventually overthrow long-held beliefs about the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn about the approach scientists use to explain observed phenomena, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/drey07.sci.phys.matter.scprocess/"&gt;Scientific Processes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn about other theories that have been refined over time, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.fund.expand/"&gt;Gravity and the Expanding Universe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.wegener1/"&gt;Plate Tectonics: The Scientist Behind the Theory&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.newtonsecret/"&gt;String Theory: Newton's Embarrassing Secret&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why does Barbara Forrest suggest it is wrong to think of evolution as "only a theory"? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the main differences between the non-scientific and scientific definition of the word "theory"? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why are scientific theories subject to change? Name two factors that can either strengthen or discredit a theory. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;According to this video segment, what are the criteria that must be met in order for a celestial body to be considered a planet?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which of these criteria does Pluto meet? Which does Pluto not meet?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think scientists disagree over whether Pluto is a planet?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Will any other planets in our solar system join Pluto in the dwarf planet category? Why or why not? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>
      <annotation>This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, presents the ongoing debate over the definition of a planet, including the status of Pluto.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn about the debate over the definition of a planet. Historically, there has been no scientific definition for a planet, leaving astronomers with the difficult task of properly classifying new discoveries in our solar system, such as Ceres and Eris. However, in August 2006, members of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) passed a resolution that defined a planet. Under the new definition, Pluto is not classified as a planet, but rather as a dwarf planet along with Ceres and Eris. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; Astronomers have attempted to develop a uniform standard of classification for the variety of astronomical objects that have been, and continue to be, discovered. The International Astronomical Union (IAU), founded in 1919 and composed of professional astronomers from around the world, serves as the authority for naming celestial bodies and the surface features found on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most hotly debated issues for the IAU to resolve was the scientific definition of a planet. For centuries, the common understanding was that a planet was a large object orbiting a star. However, with the continual advancement of technology and astronomy, new objects were being discovered that called upon the need for an official definition. This debate was fully ignited in 2005 with the discovery of a new object in our solar system larger than Pluto. Originally known as 2003 UB313, this object was eventually named Eris in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2006, members of the IAU passed a resolution that defined a planet as a celestial body that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;is in orbit around the Sun;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape (i.e., it assumes a nearly round shape due to its own gravity); and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit (i.e., it is the dominant mass in its orbit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to this definition, our solar system has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The IAU determined that Pluto has not cleared its neighborhood because it orbits among the objects of the Kuiper Belt. As such, Pluto is no longer classified as a planet, but rather as a dwarf planet. Eris has also been designated as a dwarf planet. It is expected that the list of dwarf planets will increase while the number of planets will remain at eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant controversy surrounds this definition of a planet. For the general public, it was difficult to unlearn what they had been taught about the number of planets in the solar system and to lose Pluto, often a sentimental favorite. However, in addition to the media frenzy over the demotion of Pluto, there was also protest within the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among astronomers, the objection was not over the loss of Pluto as a planet but over the wording of the definition, which is ambiguous. For example, what defines a "cleared neighborhood," and how round is "nearly round"? In addition, the definition applies only to our solar system, so there is no universal definition for a planet. Within one week of the resolution's passage, more than 300 scientists signed a petition stating that they did not agree with the IAU's definition of a planet and that a better definition was needed. As of 2006, the debate is not over. The definition put in place by the members of the IAU who voted (only about 5 percent of the world's astronomers) may yet be redefined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the planets, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.planetsize/"&gt;All Planet Sizes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about extrasolar planets, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.planetsearch/"&gt;The Search for Another Earth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.otherplanets/"&gt;A Strange New Planet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about discovering astronomical objects, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.galileomoon/"&gt;Galileo: Discovering Jupiter's Moons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how astronomy has evolved, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.galileosys/"&gt;Galileo: Sun-Centered System&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/viewing/3302_01_nsn.html" target="blank"&gt;viewing ideas on NOVA Teachers&lt;/a&gt; for this video segment.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;If Neanderthals lived in the valleys and &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; on the hilltops, what do you think the two species were competing for?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you think gave &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; "an edge" over the Neanderthals?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think that remains of &lt;em&gt;Homo sapien&lt;/em&gt; dwellings on hilltops constitute evidence that they out-competed Neanderthals? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>
      <annotation>This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, explores reasons why &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; had an advantage over Neanderthals in the pursuit of territory and natural resources.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, explores the origins of modern humans. Fossil evidence from Middle East caves and elsewhere has revealed some competitive advantages modern humans, known as &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, are believed to have held over the more archaic human species, Neanderthals. For example, during the time in which the two species may have coexisted, &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; lived on high ground, from which they could survey the landscape and plan their hunting expeditions. Some scientists have theorized that the success of this strategy may have contributed to the demise of the valley-dwelling Neanderthals, who became extinct about 30,000 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; About 100,000 years ago, a diverse group of hominids, or humanlike species, occupied Earth. By 30,000 years ago, however, only &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;the most modern species&amp;mdash;remained. One of the most hotly debated issues in paleoanthropology, the study of human origins, focuses on how &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; evolved to outlive the other hominids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current best explanation for the beginning of modern humans is the Out of Africa model. This holds that &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; arose in Africa and gradually replaced hominid species in the other parts of the world to which they migrated. To address the question of why our species survived, paleoanthropologists make certain assumptions about lifestyle and behavior based on fossil evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fossil record shows that early &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;who had a body plan more or less like our own&amp;mdash;and Neanderthals (&lt;em&gt;Homo neanderthalensis&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;mdash;a separate species characterized by a large, low-sloping cranial vault and a short, robust skeleton&amp;mdash;inhabited the same land at about the same time, between approximately 30,000 and 40,000 years ago. Both species developed hunting tools and used fire. But paleoanthropologists theorize that &lt;em&gt;Homo sapien&lt;/em&gt; understanding of geography might have given them a decisive competitive advantage. Artifacts suggest that nearly all known early &lt;em&gt;Homo sapien&lt;/em&gt; settlements were situated on hilltops and high ridges. Their ability to survey large areas of land from such vantage points would very likely have helped their hunting strategy. Neanderthals, on the other hand, lived in valleys that did not permit a clear view to the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the Neanderthals may have arrived first on the scene, the more modern species, &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, came out ahead in the competition for resources. Over a period of roughly 5,000 to perhaps 10,000 years, the Neanderthals were gradually displaced to remote areas like the British Isles, northern Germany, and southern Spain. About 30,000 years ago, they became extinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While fossil evidence suggest that the Neanderthals may have adopted some of the technologies that made modern humans more effective hunters, recent DNA evidence suggests that Neanderthals and &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; did not interbreed. Because Neanderthals did not contribute mitochondrial DNA to modern humans, they are most likely not our direct ancestors. This finding provides further support to the Out of Africa model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the evolution of hominids, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.humorigin/"&gt;Origins of Humankind&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for trends in height data of North American boys from 1880 and 1960 in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2107_origins2.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, documents a ballerina's experience with a potentially deadly eating disorder: anorexia nervosa. Research suggests that a brain chemical called serotonin plays a prominent role in regulating appetite&amp;mdash;a key factor in eating disorders. The disruption of serotonin levels by dietary changes can lead to a vicious cycle that prolongs the disorder. By restoring nutrition to her diet, however, the dancer in the video is tackling her eating disorder and resuming her career. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Appetite&amp;mdash;the desire to eat food&amp;mdash;serves to balance energy intake with metabolic needs. It is regulated by a complex process that involves the digestive tract, hormones, and the brain. While the hypothalamus region of the brain is most closely linked with regulating appetite, certain brain chemicals are also being investigated for their effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Normal brain activity relies on electrochemical communication between networks of neurons and other cells in the body. The primary messengers are known as neurotransmitters. One type of neurotransmitter, serotonin, is what brain specialists call a modulator. It acts somewhat like volume control for the brain and nervous system. Serotonin is involved with a wide range of functions, such as regulating mood and sleep cycles. Recent research suggests that serotonin levels also influence appetite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People with anorexia and those recovering from it have elevated levels of serotonin, which acts to suppress appetite. A negative feedback loop involving what the brain perceives is happening to serotonin levels and what is actually happening has the effect of prolonging the disorder. And while the higher levels of serotonin might actually result from the malnutrition associated with anorexia, some researchers suggest that disruption of serotonin levels may lead to increased anxiety, which is what initially triggers the anorexia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People who suffer from eating disorders, which range from compulsive overeating to starvation diets, can experience serious physical health complications, including heart conditions and kidney failure. Those who overeat compulsively tend to consume too much dietary fat. Too much dietary fat can, of course, be detrimental to health, leading to obesity and cholesterol buildup in the arteries. In contrast, people who suffer from anorexia typically eliminate fat from their diet. A nutritional plan that deprives one's body of fat is also unhealthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fat's main purpose is to store energy. The breaking of bonds within fat molecules releases energy that the body uses. But fats also play a critical role in many other important body functions, including digestion, insulation, and central nervous system function. If the body is deprived of fats, all of these functions can be impaired. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, fat is also needed to produce hormones, including estrogen. Estrogen plays a critical role in menstruation; it also regulates skeletal growth and bone density. So for women, a starvation diet with no fats can lead to abnormal menstrual cycles and weakened bones. This can be significant, as new bone does not typically grow after one's early 20s. Rather, the body can only replace what is lost to resorption, or the natural process of bone removal. This replacement, called remodeling, is limited to repairs of small cracks and other damage to the skeleton that can result from repeated stresses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about fats and other nutrients that help the body function at its best, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.colt.bodyneedsweb/"&gt;Body Needs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Explore in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2715_thin.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt; how healthy men and women are portrayed in the media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think the polyps only feed on plankton at night?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you think would happen to reef dwellers (e.g., coral, parrot fish, sea cucumbers) if the algae were not able to photosynthesize?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is a double diet? What do you think the advantages are, if any, of having a double diet?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does energy flow through the reef ecosystem? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>
      <annotation>This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, describes the energy flow in a coral reef, including its food web.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn how energy from sunlight is transferred through the inhabitants of the reef ecosystem. Photosynthesizing plants and algae convert light energy into chemical energy, which then gets passed through the food web to plant eaters, flesh eaters, and ultimately to scavengers and decomposers. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; All living things require energy to carry out life functions such as growth, movement, and reproduction. For nearly all ecosystems&amp;mdash;diverse collections of species that interact with each other and their physical environment&amp;mdash;the major source of energy is the sun. The flow of energy tends to follow the same basic pattern whether the ecosystem is a tropical rainforest or a coral reef. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To portray the transfer of energy through an ecosystem, ecologists use simple models called food chains. Organisms can be organized into different trophic levels, or positions in a food chain; organisms at higher trophic levels feed on those at lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As producers, plants and some microorganisms are an ecosystem's foundation species. Producers make their own food from energy that comes directly from the sun. When sunlight enters a coral reef, for example, phytoplankton, algae, and plants such as sea grasses convert the light energy into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not all organisms can make their own food. Consumers are organisms that obtain food and the energy stored within food by eating organisms. Consumers that feed only on plant life are called herbivores. Consumers that feed only on animals are called carnivores. Omnivores feed on both plants and other animals. Because organisms use about 90 percent of the energy they take in for their own survival and growth&amp;mdash;leaving only about 10 percent for the consumer that eats it&amp;mdash;there are fewer organisms supported in successively higher trophic levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scavengers and decomposers also play an important role in an ecosystem: They are its primary recyclers. Scavengers are animals that feed on dead members of different trophic levels. Decomposers, which include bacteria and fungi, break down organic waste material and return essential elements, such as nitrogen and phosphorous, to an ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a food chain shows just one possible pathway along which energy can move, most consumers have more than one food source. To portray all feeding relationships in an ecosystem, a more complex model, called a food web, is used. Each organism in a food web plays an important role, so the loss of any one species due to environmental threats such as disease and pollution can disrupt a strand and thus may potentially threaten the health of an entire ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the coral reef ecosystem and the relationships among different reef inhabitants, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.coralkid/"&gt;Coral Kid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.eco.coralreefconnections/"&gt;Coral Reef Connections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how much energy is transferred from one level to the next within a food chain, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.oate.energyflow/"&gt;Energy Flow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn how certain organisms in an ecosystem break down dead plant and animal tissue to release nutrients for reuse, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.oate.decompose/"&gt;Decomposers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the ecological importance and fragility of life in another threatened ecosystem&amp;mdash;the rainforest&amp;mdash;check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.oate.rainforest/"&gt;Amazon Rainforest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do the brain waves of mirror neurons for "doing" and for "seeing" look the same?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain why the action of mirror neurons is a big part of what makes us human.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Based on what you have just seen in the video, how would deficits in the mirror neuron system help explain the social behavior of people with autism? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>
      <annotation>This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNow&lt;/em&gt;, introduces the latest research on a system of neurons that plays a part in how people relate to each other.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNow&lt;/em&gt;, describes the recent discovery and implications of mirror neurons, a specific kind of brain cell that fires both when performing an action and when observing someone else perform the same action. It turns out that mirror neurons, which are normally associated with physical activities, might also be responsible for signaling the human brain's emotional system, which in turn allows us to empathize with other people. Their failure to work normally might explain why some people, including autistic people, do not interact well with others. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; Until recently, what doctors and scientists knew about brain function came from observing what stopped working when the brain was injured. Studying head-trauma victims, they attributed different functions to various structures of the brain. They found, for instance, that an injury to the temporal lobe of the brain often compromised a patient's language skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New technologies allow scientists to look deep within the human brain and observe what's happening there. For example, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scanners detect the levels of oxygen in blood flowing through an area of the brain. Because blood oxygen levels and brain activity are positively correlated, scientists can tell whether a given part of the brain is functioning during certain tasks: Higher oxygenation means increased neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Normal brain activity relies on communication between networks of specialized nerve cells, called neurons, and other types of cells in the body. Neurons transmit signals via electrical pulses to control the release of chemicals. These chemicals, called neurotransmitters, are then passed to other neurons or directly to the cells of a target tissue, like a muscle. Neurotransmitters have either an excitatory or an inhibitory effect on neighboring cells. This means that they can either increase or decrease the likelihood that a target cell will be stimulated to forward its own electrochemical signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One's ability to identify with and understand another person's situation, feelings, or motives is called empathy. How humans generate empathy remains a subject of debate in cognitive science. Some scientists believe they may have finally discovered its root in specific kinds of nerve cells&amp;mdash;mirror neurons. First identified in monkeys in the 1990s, mirror neurons are also known as "monkey-see, monkey-do" cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientists noted that mirror neurons were active when a monkey performed an action, like reaching out to grab a peanut, as well as when the monkey observed the same action being performed by another monkey. Thus, the neuron activity in the observer monkey mirrored that of the monkey performing the action, just as if the observer monkey had performed the action itself. Interestingly, there is evidence that a similar "observation-action" matching system exists in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Drawing on this connection, researchers have implicated the mirror neuron system in a broad range of human conditions, including certain cognitive disorders. For example, some dysfunction or deficiency in the mirror neuron system may underlie autism, which is characterized by an impaired ability to communicate and relate to others. Understanding the neural basis of autism may lead to early diagnosis and potential therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a new technology that allows scientists to monitor brain activity, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.stru.braingeo/"&gt;Brain Geography&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the structures and functions of the brain, check out &lt;a href="http://www.massgeneral.org/childhoodepilepsy" target="_blank"&gt;Growing Up with Epilepsy: Brain Anatomy and Development&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/viewing/3204_01_nsn.html" target="_blank"&gt;viewing ideas on NOVA Teachers&lt;/a&gt; for this video segment. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are some of the differences between reef dwellers' behavior in the daytime and their behavior at night?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do the organisms eaten at night differ from those eaten during the day?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are some evolutionary adaptations that nocturnal reef dwellers have developed to help them survive? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>
      <annotation>Coral reefs are often portrayed as brightly lit, bustling underwater marvels full of colorful creatures. This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, paints a different picture as it explores the nocturnal behavior of organisms in the reef.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, explores how a coral reef ecosystem changes over the course of a day. When the sun is up, colorful fish and other plant-eating animals are active and dominate the reef. At night, the plant-eaters take shelter and are replaced by nocturnal carnivores, some of which exhibit special adaptations that enable them to successfully hunt in complete darkness. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; In the life sciences, certain patterns begin to emerge when we shift our focus from studying individuals to studying collections of species and how they interact with and within their physical environment. Through careful observation of these patterns, we can enhance our understanding of the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can observe several such patterns within the coral reef environment. For example, fishes inhabit different vertical bands along the reef. Some fish live on or near the sediment, others flit between the myriad coral formations, and still others swim in the shallow waters above the reef and in the open sea surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do reef dwellers occupy distinct zones, but they also exhibit discernible feeding habits. Some reef animals are diurnal, meaning they are active only during the day, while others are nocturnal, or active primarily at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As light diminishes, daytime animals seek shelter in the reef's caves and crevices&amp;mdash;often the very same spaces vacated by their nocturnal counterparts. Included among the diurnal species are the plant-eaters (herbivores), some flesh-eaters (carnivores), and animals that feed on both plant and animal matter (omnivores).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the animals most active on the reef at night are primarily carnivorous. Shrimp make their way to the surface to feed on plankton. Thus exposed, they become easy prey for larger predators. So too do crustaceans, mollusks, and starfish, which comb the sea floor at night for food. The reef's top nocturnal predators, the tiger shark, octopus, and eel, feed on these and other available prey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many species have evolutionary adaptations that function to enhance survival in a particular environment. Nocturnal reef dwellers have evolved unique characteristics that help them find their prey with little or no available light. For example, a type of nonvisual sensory system allows certain nocturnal fish to detect even the slightest disturbance in water when a potential prey swims past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how energy flows through the variety of life that inhabits the coral reef ecosystem, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/hew06.sci.life.reg.foodweb/"&gt;Energy Flow in the Coral Reef Ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the coral reef ecosystem, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.coralkid/"&gt;Coral Kid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the relationships among different reef inhabitants, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.eco.coralreefconnections/"&gt;Coral Reef Connections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how different animals have adapted to the particular conditions of their environment, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.oate.kratts/"&gt;Kratts' Creatures&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why did Dr. Folkman's colleagues dismiss his theory at first about the importance of a blood supply to tumor growth?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think the experimental tumor grew so rapidly once the blood vessels reached it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think the experiment Dr. Folkman performed by implanting a tumor in a rabbit cornea "was not enough" for his colleagues?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the mechanism by which tumors trigger blood vessel growth? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>
      <annotation>In this video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Judah Folkman uses the scientific method to discover how cancer cells induce the formation of new blood vessels, which in turn nourish those cancer cells.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, features cancer researcher Dr. Judah Folkman and describes his approach to proving a new idea he had about how tumors grow inside the body. His idea focuses on angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. Dr. Folkman designed experiments to test his central hypothesis and thus prove the support mechanism behind tumors. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; To find the answers to scientific questions, scientists use an organized set of procedures called the scientific method. Often described in textbooks as a step-by-step process, the scientific method is, in reality, less prescribed than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A scientist begins by asking a question that can be answered by gathering evidence. Questions arise in all sorts of ways: for example, from observations, unexpected results, or the research findings of others. The scientist then develops an initial hypothesis, or possible answer to the question, arrived at based on past research or experience. In exploring the complex biology that enables cancerous tumors to grow, Dr. Judah Folkman formed his initial hypothesis based on decades of research. He suggested that tumors themselves can induce the formation of blood vessels, which in turn nourish the tumors. This phenomenon is called angiogenesis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When planning an experiment to test a hypothesis, it is important to first identify all variables&amp;mdash;the factors in an experiment that might affect the outcome. In a controlled experiment, all of the variables are kept the same except for one. The experiment would include a sample&amp;mdash;the control&amp;mdash;which is observed under normal conditions, and another sample that is subjected to the variable being studied for effect. For example, in his experiments, Dr. Folkman implanted a protein that he hypothesized would induce blood vessels to grow in corneal tissue. Because corneal tissue does not normally induce blood vessel growth, a sample of untreated corneal tissue could be used as the control against which the results of the protein implantation in a second sample of tissue could be measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Experiments should be designed so that results can be measured. Typically, scientists conduct the same experiment more than once to be sure the results can be replicated. What ultimately turned Dr. Folkman's early critics into competitors was their ability to repeat his experiments with the same results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, the results of experimentation should be analyzed and a conclusion drawn. Do the results validate the hypothesis? If not, do they contain ideas for further experimentation based on a modified hypothesis? After Dr. Folkman proved that angiogenesis occurred, he still needed to determine the mechanism behind it, so he designed a new experiment to confirm his thinking on that subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn how some scientists approach questions they cannot answer through experimentation, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.ess.earthsys.dinokill/"&gt;What Killed the Dinosaurs?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn how Galileo designed experiments that overturned centuries-old beliefs about the physical world, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.galileoexp/"&gt;Galileo: His Experiments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determine the toxicity of salt to an intracellular liver process in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2805_cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What key characteristics make a dune boom?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; List a few reasons why not all sand dunes produce booming sounds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is potential energy converted into kinetic energy in the sand dune? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>
      <annotation>This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, presents basic concepts of physics behind "booming" sand dunes. See how surface tension affects potential and kinetic energy and how it all works together to create sound.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn about the natural sound phenomenon of booming sand dunes. There are about 30 locations on Earth where sand dunes produce a low, rumbling tone. Researchers have found a few key factors that booming sand dunes have in common, including sand grains that are round and uniform in size, as well as layers of sand with different water content. Under the right conditions, loose sand will avalanche, transforming potential energy into kinetic and acoustic energy and producing a booming sound. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; There are about 30 locations around the world where sand dunes emanate a booming tone that lasts up to several minutes. The science behind these booming sand dunes is not fully understood, but researchers have noted several characteristics of the dunes that could explain this natural sound phenomenon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sand on a dune possesses energy in the form of gravitational potential energy. The greater the height of the sand dune, the more gravitational potential energy the sand on top has. When the sand on top of a steep dune is disturbed, it slides down the slope, and gravitational potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. It is this kinetic energy of the falling sand that produces the booming sound. As the sand particles bounce against each other, some of their kinetic energy is transformed into acoustic energy -- or sound, waves of vibrations transmitted through a medium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, not all avalanching sand dunes produce booming sounds. In order to produce a musical tone, the dune needs to have sand grains that are particularly round and smooth and almost uniform in size. In addition, the dune needs to have a top layer of dry sand over a layer of wet sand. When rainfall seeps into the sand, the sand becomes damp and holds together due to the surface tension of water. (Surface tension is an effect of cohesion -- the tendency of water molecules to be attracted to other water molecules.) Over time, the top layer of sand is heated by the sun, causing it to dry out. When there is less water in the sand, there is less cohesion and therefore the sand is more prone to movement. When the dry top layer is disturbed, the loose sand avalanches while the wet sand beneath it stays in place. The interaction of the dry sand particles hitting against each other produces the vibrations for the booming sound. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tone of the sound is determined by the frequency of the vibrations. Frequency, the number of vibrations per second, is related to pitch: A low-frequency vibration produces a low-pitched sound. The low-pitched rumble of the sand is influenced by the size and shape of the grains, the height of the dune, and the depth of the layer of dry sand. Because the grains of sand are fairly uniform, they tend to vibrate at roughly the same frequency. This synchronization of vibrations, or resonance, produces larger amplitudes of vibration. Amplitude is a measure of the amount of energy in the wave. The greater the amplitude, the louder the sound. In addition, the sound waves reverberate against the surface of the damp layer of sand below, contributing to the loudness of the sound. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about potential and kinetic energy, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/hew06.sci.phys.maf.trebuchet/"&gt;Energy Transfer in a Trebuchet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the conservation of energy, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/hew06.sci.phys.maf.springmass/"&gt;Masses and Springs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/hew06.sci.phys.maf.rollercoaster/"&gt;Energy in a Roller Coaster Ride&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about sound waves, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/hew06.sci.phys.energy.sound/"&gt;Sound&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about how sound is produced, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfe.ztunefork/"&gt;Sound and Solids: Visualizing Vibrations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>On &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, a team of carpenters, timber framers, engineers, and historians recreate a medieval throwing machine called a trebuchet. This adapted video segment explores how understanding energy transfer informs their design.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, a team of historians, engineers, and trade experts recreate a medieval throwing machine called a trebuchet. To launch a projectile, a trebuchet utilizes the transfer of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy. A massive counterweight at one end of a lever falls because of gravity, causing the other end of the lever to rise and release a projectile from a sling. As part of their design process, the engineers use models to help evaluate how well their designs will work. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; In medieval times, one of the most fearsome weapons was a trebuchet&amp;mdash;a powerful machine used to hurl projectiles. Combining the launching capabilities of a catapult and a sling, trebuchets were able to throw massive objects at high speeds and over great distances. Trebuchets were also more accurate than a basic catapult and more powerful than a simple sling; they could throw objects hundreds of pounds in weight to targets hundreds of yards away. During a siege, a trebuchet could be used to crumble castle walls by launching large rocks or to spread disease to the people inside the castle walls by tossing over dead animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine what would happen on a seesaw (a simple lever) if a book were placed on one end and you were to jump on the other end&amp;mdash;the book would go flying into the air. A trebuchet functions similarly, except that the pivot point of the lever is placed off-center (in this case, farther away from the load) to amplify the force that launches the projectile. The load, or object to be moved, is placed in a sling (composed of a pouch and two cords) attached to the long arm of the lever. A very heavy counterweight is attached to the short arm of the lever. When the counterweight falls, the long arm of the lever is raised very quickly into the air, pulling the sling up with it. As the sling swings into a vertical position, one end of the sling is unleashed, opening up the sling and releasing the load at a high velocity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To put a trebuchet into its "cocked" position, a team of people use their energy to hoist the counterweight. When the counterweight is raised, it gains this energy as potential energy. In this case, the potential energy is gravitational potential energy&amp;mdash;energy that results from the position of an object in a gravitational field. The amount of gravitational potential energy is dependent on both the weight of the object and its position, or height, above the ground. Since the counterweight in a trebuchet is very heavy, it has a great deal of potential energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can change forms. The potential energy from the raised counterweight is transformed into kinetic energy&amp;mdash;the energy of motion&amp;mdash;as the counterweight is released and begins to fall. The downward motion of the counterweight then causes the sling to swing and the projectile to be released. The potential energy that was stored in the raised counterweight is transferred, in the form of kinetic energy, to the projectile, which is released at a high velocity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about potential and kinetic energy, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfe.zsplcar/"&gt;Potential and Kinetic Energy: Spool Racer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/hew06.sci.phys.maf.rollercoaster/"&gt;Energy in a Roller Coaster Ride&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the conservation of energy, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/hew06.sci.phys.maf.springmass/"&gt;Masses and Springs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about levers, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.obelisk/"&gt;Lever an Obelisk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about projectile motion, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/hew06.sci.phys.maf.projmotion/"&gt;Projectile Motion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.galileoexp/"&gt;Galileo: His Experiments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Design a working model of a trebuchet and demonstrate the power of a Class 1 lever in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/27ms_sle2treb.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, scientists in western Greenland explain how a glacier there is shrinking and moving faster due to increased melting.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; features western Greenland's Jakobshavn Glacier, dubbed the world's fastest-flowing glacier. Scientists attempt to explain why this glacier is moving at a rate that far exceeds the average speed of glaciers and is contributing to a rise in global sea level. Their explanation revolves around the recent discovery that increased meltwater caused by global warming flows down holes in the glacier. Once it reaches the underlying rock, the theory goes, this water actually lubricates and lifts the glacier, allowing it to glide downhill with decreased resistance. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; Although ice is generally perceived to be rigid, glaciers are never stationary. Because the weight of their accumulated snow and ice is so great, gravity actually forces glaciers to spread outward and downslope. Thus, glaciers are rightly said to "flow" just like rivers&amp;mdash;down mountain valleys, across plains, or into the sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientists familiar with glaciers expect to see movement of about 10 inches per day. The mechanism of ice movement varies. In all glaciers, movement along the underside of a glacier is slower than movement at the top due to the friction created as it slides along the ground's surface. For glaciers whose base is frozen to the bedrock, ice can move only by slow deformation. A thin layer of water forms under other glaciers, allowing ice to slide downslope at a much faster rate as it meets far less resistance from the bedrock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greenland's continental ice sheet contains the second largest amount of frozen fresh water in the world (after Antarctica). A part of this ice sheet, the Jakobshavn Glacier, is located on the western coast of Greenland. According to GPS measurements, this glacier is presently flowing as fast as 113 feet per day, making it the world&amp;rsquo;s fastest-flowing glacier. As its leading edge reaches the Arctic Ocean, more than 20 million tons of icebergs calve off from it each day. This addition of fresh water to the sea&amp;mdash;the equivalent of 12 trillion gallons each year&amp;mdash;contributes to rising sea level. In fact, this glacier alone is responsible for 4 percent of the global sea-level rise we have seen in recent times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Researchers investigating the Jakobshavn for clues as to why it moves so fast monitor various climate factors, including wind speed and humidity. The main influencing factor, however, appears to be surface temperature, which is rising in both summer and winter. In the warmer summer months, melted snow and ice pools in a surface lake. This then drains down a hole that leads to the bedrock. There, the water lifts the glacier fractionally and provides a lubricating layer on which the glacier slides downhill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The poles are extremely sensitive to environmental changes, and temperatures have been increasing more rapidly there than anywhere else on the globe. Should icebergs and glaciers melt and spill large quantities of fresh water into the ocean, the freshening could influence global ocean circulation patterns. Cold North Atlantic Deep Water sinks because of its high salt content and density and travels southward. At the same time, the warmer Gulf Stream travels north, redistributing heat from the Equator. If sufficient fresh water entered the oceans, impeding development of the North Atlantic Deep Water, the Atlantic thermohaline conveyor and the Gulf Stream current could shut down in just a few years, dramatically altering climate worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about how and where glaciers form as well as the names of different parts of a glacier, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.glaciers/"&gt;Glaciers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about how glacial melting might affect global sea level, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.icemelt/"&gt;Mountain of Ice: If the Ice Melts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ipy07.sci.ess.watcyc.icesimulate/"&gt;Ice Shelf and Ice Sheet Simulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about how water is circulated in the world's oceans, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.convey/"&gt;Great Ocean Conveyor Belt: Part I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.convey2/"&gt;Great Ocean Conveyor Belt: Part II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn about some other possible explanations for fast-moving glaciers, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.icestreams/"&gt;Antarctic Ice Movement: Part II&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;How fast is this glacier's movement compared to the average movement of glaciers worldwide?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What is the scientists' explanation for the increased speed of the Jakobsavn Glacier? What evidence did they use for their explanation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why doesn't the surface meltwater freeze as it flows through the ice to the bottom of the glacier?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; This glacier is very far from where most of us live. Do you think it is important for all of us to pay attention to the speeding up of the movement of glaciers in Greenland? Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; shows how the common wood frog freezes solid every winter, an adaptation that allows the organism to survive the cold winter.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn how the common wood frog survives the cold winter. Wood frogs are found in the northern United States and Canada and must endure freezing cold temperatures for parts of the year. In order to survive the cold, they have a special adaptation&amp;mdash;they are able to freeze solid without damaging their cells. Sugar acts like a natural antifreeze in their bodies, allowing them to spend the winter frozen and then resume function in the spring. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; Organisms that are best suited to their environment (either physically or behaviorally) survive and reproduce with the greatest success. Any organisms that are not well suited to their environment soon die out. As a result of this natural selection that occurs over the course of many generations, species evolve with particular traits&amp;mdash;biological adaptations&amp;mdash;that allow them to better survive in their habitats. One such adaptation is freeze tolerance, which allows certain organisms&amp;mdash;such as some species of frogs, snakes, lizards, and turtles&amp;mdash;to survive in very cold habitats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most organisms suffer injury when exposed to freezing temperatures: ice crystals form in their bodies, damaging cells and tissues. When ice crystals form in the area just outside of cells, they deform the cells and puncture cell membranes. In addition, ice is made of pure water, so as it crystallizes, it leaves behind solutes (substances that were dissolved in the water). As the solutes become more concentrated outside the cells, water inside the cells diffuses across the cell membranes through osmosis in an effort to equalize the concentrations of solutes inside and outside the cells. As a result, the cells become dehydrated from the loss of water and shrink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The wood frog, found in the northern United States and Canada, has adaptations that help it survive the freezing temperatures that are typical of its habitat. It is able to prevent cell and tissue damage by circulating large amounts of cryoprotectants (such as glucose) throughout its body before it freezes. The cryoprotectants act as a natural form of antifreeze that prevents the insides of the cells from freezing. High levels of cryoprotectants inside cells also minimize the amount of water that diffuses out of the cells, which reduces both the amount of ice that forms around the cells and cell shrinkage. In addition, the wood frog's body also prepares for freezing by moving some water to areas where it would do the least harm, such as between layers of skin and muscle. Through these mechanisms, the wood frog can survive at temperatures several degrees below freezing, with 65-70 percent of its body water in the form of ice. While frozen, the wood frog has no heartbeat and does not breathe or move. However, because it is possible for its body functions to resume, the frog is not dead, but rather preserved in this frozen state. When the temperature warms up, its body thaws and resumes normal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about speciation, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.adraddarfinch/"&gt;Adaptive Radiation: Darwin's Finches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.anorigin/"&gt;An Origin of Species&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about biological adaptation, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.camouflage/"&gt;Evolution of Camouflage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about diffusion through cell membranes, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.cell.membraneweb/"&gt;Cell Membrane: Just Passing Through&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is it beneficial for the wood frog to become frozen during the winter? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What evolutionary process is at work here? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why can the frog freeze and thaw but you cannot? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What adaptations for protection from the cold do other animals in temperate regions have? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; explores a mechanism called RNA interference (RNAi), which has evolved in cells to prevent viral infection. Cells must carefully regulate the synthesis of proteins from genes to ensure normal development and to prevent disease. Having accidentally discovered this mechanism while experimenting with color in petunias, scientists now know that RNAi serves a critical role in this process. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; In 1998, scientists discovered that petunias, nematodes, fruit flies, mice, and even humans use a built-in cellular mechanism to protect their genome (set of genes) from attacks by viruses. Normally, when a gene is turned on, it makes an RNA copy of itself that leaves the nucleus and serves as a message to direct the production of a specific protein. The RNA that is part of this process exists as a single strand. When a virus attacks the cell's genome, it carries a double-stranded form of RNA that enters the cell. A newly discovered cellular mechanism called RNA interference, or RNAi, recognizes this double-stranded RNA as a dangerous invader. It sets out to destroy not only all double-stranded RNA but also any single-stranded RNA messages in the cell that have a sequence like that found in the double-stranded RNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A few years later, scientists discovered that many, if not most, organisms use RNAi not just to prevent viral infections, but to regulate the expression of their own genes. Scientists have recently discovered a new class of RNA molecules called microRNAs. These microRNAs are produced during the early stages of an organism's development. They bind with matching single-stranded RNA molecules that are involved with protein synthesis. When a microRNA binds to its matching messenger RNA, it forms a double-stranded RNA that is recognized by the RNAi system, which then destroys it. This RNAi mechanism silences the expression of that particular gene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today, scientists are using the RNAi mechanism to learn more about what particular genes do and how to alter their function. Determining gene function is a relatively simple matter of inserting double-stranded RNA molecules that have a particular sequence into cells and observing the effects after RNAi silences the corresponding gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conceivably, this method may one day be used to silence gene mutations that cause human diseases such as Huntington's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and many others. By using either the body's own mutations or viral invaders, scientists may develop a new type of drug&amp;mdash;for example, one that switches off the genes of a cancer cell and leaves healthy cells unaffected. However, because RNAi's potential effects are so powerful, scientists must first determine that they can control the mechanism so that only the target gene is silenced, and not others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about RNAi's role in protein synthesis, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/lsps07.sci.life.gen.rnaiexplain/"&gt;RNAi Explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about RNAi and its potential use as a medical treatment, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/lsps07.sci.life.gen.rnaitherapy/"&gt;RNAi Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about protein synthesis, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.proteinsynth/"&gt;From DNA to Protein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.dnaworkshop/"&gt;DNA Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/lsps07.sci.life.stru.cellprotein/"&gt;How Do Cells Make Proteins?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about how genetic mutations can affect the synthesis of various proteins, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.onewrong/"&gt;One Wrong Letter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.mutationstory/"&gt;A Mutation Story&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.howcancergrows/"&gt;How Cancer Grows&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/viewing/3210_02_nsn.html" target="_blank"&gt;viewing ideas on NOVA Teachers&lt;/a&gt; for this video segment. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>Using scientific animations and illustrated metaphors, this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; explains RNAi and how it works.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; illustrates the function of RNA interference (RNAi), a mechanism by which cells interrupt the process of protein synthesis. By effectively silencing genes, RNAi helps to fight infections. Scientists hope that one day they will be able to use this powerful mechanism in the treatment of a wide variety of genetic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; Genes provide the instructions that cells use to produce, or synthesize, proteins, which are necessary for the proper functioning of an organism. Protein synthesis from genes occurs in two basic steps: transcription and translation. During transcription, instructions contained in DNA are copied to a single-stranded molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). Messenger RNA is subsequently translated into an amino acid chain (a protein) whose sequence corresponds to that particular mRNA molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cells typically perform these steps flawlessly&amp;mdash;producing vital proteins in just the right quantities, at just the right times. When things go wrong, it is commonly the result of the cells being "hijacked" by outside invaders. Viruses infect cells by inserting their own RNA "recipes" into cells. Viral attacks typically lead to abnormal development and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RNA interference (RNAi) is a recently discovered mechanism that cells use to prevent such outcomes by interfering with protein synthesis. The RNAi mechanism is activated by the presence of double-stranded molecules of RNA in the cytoplasm, the fluid surrounding the cell nucleus. Double-stranded RNA indicates abnormality in a cell, as RNA normally produced by the cell is single stranded. Double-stranded RNA molecules may come from viruses or may be part of the cell's own mechanism to inhibit the production of certain proteins at certain times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the RNAi molecules detect an offending molecule, a protein complex, which scientists call "Dicer," cuts the double-stranded RNA into fragments. Next, a molecule called "RISC" binds to one fragment of the offending RNA and uses this fragment to detect single-stranded mRNA with the corresponding sequence. Whenever RISC encounters corresponding mRNA molecules, it cuts and degrades those molecules such that they can no longer be used to synthesize proteins. By degrading all mRNA with this sequence and inhibiting the production of the protein it codes for, RNAi can effectively limit the effects of viral RNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After scientists discovered RNAi, they soon realized that this naturally occurring mechanism could potentially be manipulated to block, or "silence," just about any gene's normal activity. Today, RNAi is being used experimentally to treat a small number of genetic disorders. However, because manipulation of gene function is not without its risks, scientists and doctors are proceeding as cautiously with RNAi as they have with similar potential medical therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the discovery of RNAi and its function in the cell, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/lsps07.sci.life.gen.rnai/"&gt;RNAi Discovered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about how RNAi may be used to treat genetic disorders and infectious diseases, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/lsps07.sci.life.gen.rnaitherapy/"&gt;RNAi Therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about protein synthesis, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.proteinsynth/"&gt;From DNA to Protein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.dnaworkshop/"&gt;DNA Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/lsps07.sci.life.stru.cellprotein/"&gt;How Do Cells Make Proteins?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about how genetic mutations can affect the synthesis of various proteins, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.onewrong/"&gt;One Wrong Letter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.mutationstory/"&gt;A Mutation Story&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.howcancergrows/"&gt;How Cancer Grows&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn about RNAi's potential to treat a wide range of genetic and infectious diseases.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn how RNA interference (RNAi), a mechanism that operates in cells to silence gene expression, is being explored by researchers as a therapeutic approach to treating a host of diseases. A genetic malfunction is causing a patient to lose her vision because of the over-production of blood vessels in her eyes. To treat this genetic malfunctioning, scientists attempt to manipulate the mechanism so that genes that normally trigger production of blood vessels instead do the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; In their pursuit to cure infectious as well as inherited diseases, scientists are testing several cutting-edge therapies. These include gene therapy, antisense therapy, and an approach called RNAi therapy. Although each of these approaches has potential, many experts consider RNAi to be the most promising so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As this video segment demonstrates, RNAi has already been successfully used to treat macular degeneration, an eye condition in which too many blood vessels grow underneath the retina, which leads to sight loss. Other potential disease targets include Huntington's disease, hepatitis, and breast cancer. RNAi can theoretically be used to treat any infection or disease that is caused by the overproduction of a normal protein, the production of an abnormal protein, or the production of a harmful foreign protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RNAi therapy is based on cells' natural response when they detect infection or genetic abnormality. Double-stranded RNA molecules in the cytoplasm signal abnormality in a cell, as RNA normally produced by the cell is single stranded. Double-stranded RNA molecules may come from viruses or may be part of the cell's own mechanism to inhibit the production of certain proteins. When the RNAi molecules detect either of these abnormal molecules, a protein complex, which scientists call "Dicer," cuts the double-stranded RNA into fragments. Next, a molecule called "RISC" binds to one fragment of the offending RNA and uses this fragment to detect single-stranded mRNA with the corresponding sequence. Whenever RISC encounters corresponding mRNA molecules, it cuts and degrades those molecules so that they can no longer be used to synthesize proteins. By inhibiting the production of the protein it codes for, RNAi can effectively block, or "silence," a specific gene's activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides its ability to selectively target genes, another advantage of the RNAi approach is that it is comparatively easy for scientists to make RNAi drugs. These drugs consist of small strands of RNA&amp;mdash;each about 22 bases long&amp;mdash;that can be synthesized by a machine. Further, because the RNAi mechanism passes from cell to cell, it would therefore maintain or even increase its effectiveness over time. That said, the power of the RNAi mechanism also carries potential risk. To use it effectively, scientists need to better understand how to inhibit the synthesis of a target protein without influencing the synthesis of any other proteins. The challenge, then, is to deliver the synthetic RNA molecules only to the cells that matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about RNAi's role in protein synthesis, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/lsps07.sci.life.gen.rnaiexplain/"&gt;RNAi Explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the discovery of RNAi and its function in the cell, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/lsps07.sci.life.gen.rnai/"&gt;RNAi Discovered&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about protein synthesis, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.proteinsynth/"&gt;From DNA to Protein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.dnaworkshop/"&gt;DNA Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/lsps07.sci.life.stru.cellprotein/"&gt;How Do Cells Make Proteins?&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, follow scientists in their quest to understand how stable elements are made and how to create the elusive element 114.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn how nuclear chemists are conducting their search for new elements. Scientists have encountered tremendous challenges working with heavy elements&amp;mdash;those whose atomic weights exceed anything nature has created&amp;mdash;because of the atomic forces at work, which include electromagnetic forces and the strong nuclear force. This video explores the concept of an "island of stability"&amp;mdash;a stable new element that scientists predict should be possible to create amidst highly unstable and fleeting ones. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; An element is defined according to the number of protons contained inside the nucleus of each atom. No two elements have the same number of protons, hence each element has a unique atomic number. The periodic table lists 90 naturally occurring elements&amp;mdash;meaning those created in the aftermath of the Big Bang or later forged in the heat and pressure of stars. A further 28 elements have been created by humans in a laboratory setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The higher its atomic number, the heavier and less stable an element is. Elements are considered stable when the repulsive force that exists between positively charged protons is effectively countered by another force, the strong nuclear force, which corrals protons and chargeless neutrons and prevents them from bursting out of the nucleus. Heavy elements are unstable because their atoms contain lots of protons. While the strong force is about 100 times stronger than the electromagnetic repulsion between two protons, it is a short-range force. The electromagnetic force begins to overwhelm the strong force as the number of protons in a nucleus approaches 100 and the nucleus becomes over-large. When breakup, or decay, occurs, the energy pent up inside the nucleus is released in the form of radiation and a spray of particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientists have proven that it is possible to create new heavy elements artificially by taking an existing element and adding protons and neutrons&amp;mdash;together called nucleons&amp;mdash;to its nucleus. Frequently, they do this by bombarding an atom with nucleons with the hope that these nucleons are successfully incorporated into the nucleus. But as more protons are added to a nucleus, their tendency to repel one another gets stronger and stronger. Consequently, experimental heavy atoms tend to rip apart almost instantaneously. Their very brief existence makes it difficult for scientists to study their characteristics for potential applications in science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The nuclear chemists trying to create element 114 are hopeful that this heavy atom would be longer-lived. Since the 1950s, scientists have viewed atomic nuclei as being built up in rings, a model similar to that of electron shells within the atom. According to this revised model, a ring filled with very precise numbers of protons and neutrons would give an element stability, even if elements nearby on the periodic table were highly unstable. For example, certain forms, or isotopes, of thorium (atomic number 90) and uranium (92) are the only naturally occurring atoms heavier than bismuth (83) that are relatively stable amidst other, far less stable elements. The elusive element 114 discussed in this video segment is, hypothetically, another "island of stability" in a "sea of instability." Scientists just have to find a way to get the "magic numbers" of 114 protons and 184 neutrons inside a nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about how the periodic table arranges elements and can even help predict characteristics of new ones, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.ptable/"&gt;Periodic Table of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/lsps07.sci.phys.matter.graphperiodic/"&gt;Graphing the Periodic Table&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about how we know that Earth's naturally occurring elements were created in stars, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.origin/"&gt;The Origin of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the structure of atoms, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.atoms/"&gt;Atoms: The Space Between&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.atombuilder/"&gt;Atom Builder&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the strong nuclear force, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.oddmanout/"&gt;String Theory: Gravity - The Odd Man Out&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find viewing ideas for this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/viewing/3313_02_nsn.html" target="blank"&gt;video segment on NOVA Teachers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What explanation is proposed for the observation that protons with like charges (+) can stay close together in the nucleus of an atom? Why don't they repel each other right out of the nucleus? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is meant by the "island of stability"? Why is it called an island? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What reasoning did the scientists use to predict the properties of element 114? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think it is so very difficult to have a direct collision between nuclei? Is it something to do with the size of the particles? Their charge? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What other combinations of two elements would, mathematically at least, yield the nucleus of element 114? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn the mechanisms that determine how genetic mutations influence an organism's development.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; examines how mutations in different regions of an organism's DNA affect gene expression&amp;mdash;whether genes are turned on or off during the organism's development. An animated model depicts two DNA segments in the nucleus of a fertilized egg. Each segment contains a coding gene, enhancers in the noncoding regulatory region, and other DNA not associated with the gene. As the egg develops, each cell produces its own proteins. Whether and where these proteins bind to the DNA determines gene expression. Mutations can change how receptors in each of the regions permit or prevent such binding. This, in turn, influences which traits are displayed.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Typically, when we think of genetic mutations, we think of DNA-copying errors during cell division, or perhaps the impact of environmental factors. But it turns out that mutations in regulatory mechanisms&amp;mdash;not just in genetic code&amp;mdash;can also explain how species come to exhibit new traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a cell divides, it makes a copy of its DNA instructions for the new cell. The double helix structure unwinds and the strands separate. The nucleotides (adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine) on each strand pair up with free nucleotides in the nucleus, creating two new strands. Every time a cell divides, it must copy about 6,000 million letters of DNA code. Sometimes errors, or mutations, occur so that a single nucleotide base is changed or entire sequences of DNA are accidentally deleted. Mutations can also be caused by environmental agents, including UV rays in sunlight, cigarette smoke, and radiation, which can alter bases so they look like other bases or break the phosphate "backbone" of DNA. Our cells have built-in mechanisms that catch and repair most mutations that occur during replication or from environmental damage. But some mutations inevitably get through and result in new traits being passed on to offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have recently discovered that regions of DNA once believed to have no particular function can contain molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating gene expression. These mechanisms, called gene switches, determine whether certain traits are expressed as an organism develops. Thus, depending on whether a gene is switched on or left off, a single gene can produce very different traits in a species. When a mutation occurs in a noncoding region and a gene switch is added or deleted, new traits can result. Provided the new traits are not fatal, they may be passed on to offspring and eventually result in new species being formed. For example, as the interactive activity demonstrates, a creature may display or lack specific structures, such as spots on its body or appendages at different locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gene switch mutation explains why some people have blue eyes. Up until about 6,000 to 10,000 years ago, all humans had brown eyes. Then, a mutation in the gene involved in the production of melanin&amp;mdash;the pigment that gives eyes their color&amp;mdash;resulted in a switch present in some people's genes that controls how much melanin is produced in the iris. This switch does not turn melanin production on or off; rather, it limits how much is produced. Thus, it effectively dilutes brown eyes to blue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about gene switches, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/novat10.sci.life.evo.fruitfly/"&gt;Switching Genes On and Off&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how genetic information is copied, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.nutsbolts/"&gt;The Nuts and Bolts of DNA Replication&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.dnaanimation/"&gt;How DNA Replicates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about diseases caused by gene mutations, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.mutationstory/"&gt;A Mutation Story&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.howcancergrows/"&gt;How Cancer Grows&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.onewrong/"&gt;One Wrong Letter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; invites you to do the work of scientists and use a database to classify actual fossil records of human ancestors and related species.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, explore one of the challenges that evolutionary scientists face as you attempt to classify 10 "mystery fossils." Examine the data associated with each fossil to determine the genus and species to which it belongs, or to create your own reasoned classification. Interpret the facts associated with each fossil to explain how each classification helps define a stage related to human evolution. Lastly, using data to support your claims, assemble your own theories about the stages of human evolution. The activity demonstrates where the fossil record tells a complete story, and where gaps remain.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;In the 150 years since Darwin described the origin of species, scientists have gathered extensive fossil evidence in support of his theory of evolution by natural selection. This evidence helps them understand how humans have evolved from a common ancestry with apes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many scientists focus on locomotion, diet, and cranial capacity as key characteristics to understand human evolution. For example, bipedalism, or walking on two feet, is used to separate the earliest human ancestors from the ancestors of apes. In bipeds, the &lt;em&gt;foramen magnum&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;the large opening through which the spinal cord enters the skull&amp;mdash;is located near the middle of the skull. In quadrupeds, or animals that walk on four feet, it is located toward the back of the skull. Likewise, the shape and position of the pelvis (hip), femur (leg), and tibia (shinbone) distinguish bipeds from quadrupeds, as do the relative lengths of their lower limbs and upper limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing fossilized skull characteristics provides clues about diet that help anthropologists classify species of &lt;em&gt;hominins&lt;/em&gt;, the term used for humans and human ancestors. For instance, the larger crests, longer faces, and narrowing of the skull behind the eye sockets of modern apes and early hominins help support the powerful jaw muscles required to consume hard diets. Scientists assert that the reduction in these features that came with softer diets may have allowed for the development of larger brains in more modern hominins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists often interpret such facts by classifying similar fossils into groups with similar characteristics, thus defining genera and species that represent key stages in the evolution of human ancestors. By doing this, they give structure and meaning to fossils. However, species classification can be difficult. Many gaps in the fossil record remain and new fossil discoveries challenge scientists to revise their classifications. To complicate the process further, while dates of fossils reveal when these human ancestors existed, it is not possible to determine when they first appeared and when they went extinct or evolved into other species. For example, there is no clear date to define the transition from &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, or whether &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt; even gave rise to &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, while defining species is essential for understanding evolutionary trends, classifying fossils involves constant reorganizing of data as new techniques and findings emerge. Many questions about our human evolutionary tree remain unanswered. Although facts associated with each fossil may be clear and general facts of human evolution are well established, the process of classifying fossils based on those facts is one of scientific interpretation, leaving the specifics of human evolution up for continued debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about bipedalism, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/novat10.sci.life.evo.lucy/"&gt;Fossil Evidence of Bipedalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.transleap/"&gt;The Transforming Leap, from Four Legs to Two&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.walktall/"&gt;Walking Tall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about human evolution, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.findinglucy/"&gt;Finding Lucy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.laetolifoot/"&gt;Laetoli Footprints&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.humev/"&gt;Evolving Ideas: Did Humans Evolve?&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.humorigin/"&gt;Origins of Humankind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about other fossil finds that support the theory of evolution, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.howhappens/"&gt;Evolving Ideas: How Do We Know Evolution Happens?&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/evol07.sci.life.evo.fossilev/"&gt;Transitional Tetrapod Fossil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.fishfingers/"&gt;Fish with Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.whalesinmaking/"&gt;Whales in the Making&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how comparing physical traits helps establish evolutionary relationships, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.allinthefamily/"&gt;All in the Family&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; reveals how "junk" DNA helped solve an evolutionary mystery: Why do certain species of fruit flies have wing spots while others don't?</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, evolutionary scientist Sean Carroll investigates why one species of fruit fly has wing spots while another genetically similar one does not. As the video explains, although two organisms may both possess the same gene linked to a particular trait, this trait may not be expressed unless the gene is turned on. This is done by an enhancer, a piece of noncoding DNA&amp;mdash;previously thought of as "junk" DNA&amp;mdash;that acts as a "switch." &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The new science of evolutionary developmental biology, or "evo devo," applies lessons from the development of individual organisms to a broader understanding of changes in groups over the course of evolution. By studying developing organisms, scientists have learned that certain regions of DNA that were long believed to have no function actually regulate gene expression by controlling where, when, and even to what degree a particular gene is turned on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All living things get their building and operating instructions from DNA. Coiled inside the nucleus of the cell, DNA stores all the information needed for an individual to develop and function as a living organism. The information is packaged in genes, the units of heredity, which are distributed along the chromosomes of an organism. Each gene contains a coded instruction for making a single protein, and it is proteins that influence the collection of traits an organism has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein-making instructions of DNA come from short sections called coding regions, or exons. The term "junk" DNA was originally coined to refer to regions of DNA on either side of the coding regions that seemed to contain no genetic information. However, scientists have recently discovered that these "junk" regions actually contain molecular mechanisms called gene switches that govern whether, when, and in some cases how much of a gene is activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene switches are the binding sites for regulatory molecules. These are proteins that, when they land on a gene switch, trigger transcription and thus express the gene. Transcription is the process whereby the DNA sequence in a gene is copied into mRNA and ultimately translated into a protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video examines two related fruit fly species (&lt;em&gt;Drosophila biarmipes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/em&gt;), both of which have a so-called paintbrush gene responsible for coloration in the flies. Both species have switches that govern how the paintbrush gene is used. For example, one switch along the noncoding DNA region colors the abdomen of both flies in the same manner. However, &lt;em&gt;D. biarmipes&lt;/em&gt; has an additional switch that controls expression of the paintbrush gene in cells in the wings as well. As the fruit flies demonstrate, the same gene can produce very different traits in two species. One species uses the paintbrush gene to make wing spots, while the other doesn't. It all depends on how the gene is regulated during development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sean Carroll, who is featured in this video, hypothesizes that evolution happens not by making new genes, but because of mutation to switches that do new things with existing genes. When a gene switch is added or deleted, new variations result. As new traits get passed on to offspring, new species are eventually formed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how genetic information is copied, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.nutsbolts/"&gt;The Nuts and Bolts of DNA Replication&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.dnaanimation/"&gt;How DNA Replicates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how mutations affect gene expression, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/novat10.sci.life.evo.evodevo/"&gt;Regulating Genes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about diseases caused by gene mutations, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.mutationstory/"&gt;A Mutation Story&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.howcancergrows/"&gt;How Cancer Grows&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.onewrong/"&gt;One Wrong Letter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how proteins are made inside a cell, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.proteinsynth/"&gt;From DNA to Protein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.dnaworkshop/"&gt;DNA Workshop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; shows how scientists use the fossil record to trace when early human ancestors and related species began walking on two legs instead of four, and to determine whether they were more apelike or human in appearance.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, see how paleoanthropologists&amp;mdash;including Don Johanson, with his famous discovery of the &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/em&gt; "Lucy"&amp;mdash;have used the fossil record to identify a large number of fairly similar bipedal species that encompass ancestors of humans and related species. These species, which walked upright like humans, but resembled apes in small brain size and in facial structure, flourished as a group for millions of years. Scientists still debate which of these species was our direct ancestor. The video features a comparison of Lucy's fossilized pelvis bone with that of an ape, and shows how strikingly similar Lucy's is to a human one.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Our big brains set humans apart from other animals. Our ability to walk upright also distinguishes us from apes, with whom we share a common ancestor. However, in Darwin's day, and for many decades afterwards, too few fossils had been found to solve the mystery of which came first: intelligence or bipedalism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Johanson's 1973 discovery of "Lucy," a half-complete skeleton of a previously unknown species of hominid, proved critical to understanding this aspect of human evolution. In offering evidence for how humans diverged from apes, scientists cite specific features in Lucy's anatomy. Although she displayed subtle but important differences in skull structure, she largely retained an apelike upper body. However, it was her lower body, in particular her pelvis and knee joints, that helped scientists determine the order in which changes occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bipedalism, or walking on two feet, is what separated the earliest human ancestors from the earliest ape ancestors. The shape and position of the pelvis (hip), femur (leg), and tibia (shinbone) distinguish bipeds from quadrupeds, or animals that walk on four feet. As the video states, Lucy was like a human from the waist down. Her knee joints locked straight, a feature characteristic of upright walkers. And in bone structure and orientation, her pelvis more closely resembled a modern human's than a chimp's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucy was clearly capable of walking bipedally. Her funnel-shaped ribcage and broad pelvis indicate that she probably had a large belly, like a modern ape, reflecting an adaptation to a relatively low-quality, high-bulk diet. However, the thick waist this gave her would have hindered her flexibility, and her high shoulders and the shape of her torso suggest it would have been difficult for her to swing her arms as humans do when running. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, a three-million-year-old fossil showed that bipedalism was the first step toward becoming human&amp;mdash;long before the earliest stone tools were made or any language was developed. Lucy's species, &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/em&gt;, was just one of many apelike human ancestors that walked upright on two legs. Subsequent fossil finds of much earlier bipedal hominids have confirmed this. As a group, small-brained bipedal apes inhabited Earth for millions of years before modern humans, &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, evolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, one compelling hypothesis, proposed by evolutionary biology professor Daniel Lieberman, suggests that bipedalism evolved to preserve energy. As seen by examining the fossil record, several species of upright walkers evolved with subtle anatomical differences between them. Minor increases in hip extension and leg length, for example, would have saved early transitional forms at least some energy. The compound effect of small changes ultimately yielded large energy savings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the discovery of "Lucy" and bipedalism, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.findinglucy/"&gt;Finding Lucy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.transleap/"&gt;The Transforming Leap, from Four Legs to Two&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.walktall/"&gt;Walking Tall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about human evolution, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.laetolifoot/"&gt;Laetoli Footprints&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.humev/"&gt;Evolving Ideas: Did Humans Evolve?&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.humorigin/"&gt;Origins of Humankind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn how scientists classify fossils of human ancestors and other species, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/novat10.sci.life.evo.fossildb/"&gt;Bones of Contention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn about engineering innovations that could help detect a bridge's structural weaknesses before they become dangerous.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; features two engineering innovations designed to improve structural safety in bridges. Using the 2007 Interstate-35 bridge collapse in Minneapolis to demonstrate the potential hazard facing thousands of deficient U.S. bridges today, the video shows how sound waves can be used to detect cracks in steel and other signs of instability undetected by the human eye. A second approach involves painting onto the bridge a "sensing skin" made of microscopic carbon nanotubes that use electrical currents to reveal structural damage or weak spots.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;While safety inspections are a routine part of building, bridge, and airplane maintenance, structural problems can be missed because inspectors still rely heavily on their eyes to detect them. This means that a flaw below the surface or one too small to be seen may go completely unnoticed. As most structural failures stem from minute cracks that grow over time and use, early detection is essential to ensure safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several new technologies have emerged from a new approach in engineering called structural health monitoring. Two examples of these sensor-based systems&amp;mdash;both featured in this video segment&amp;mdash;include an acoustic wave system, which is similar to sonar, and carbon nanotube paint, an innovation still in development that uses electrical currents to detect flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An acoustic wave system uses sound to collect critical data about structural elements. Employing a network of electrical patches placed along the structure's surface, this system can signal defects before small problems become catastrophic. Any of the patches can emit a "ping" of high-frequency sound waves from its location. As with sonar, the waves bounce off objects they bump into and return to their source. As this happens, the patch switches to sensor mode and "listens" to the returning signal, or sound echo. This echo contains information that, when interpreted by pattern-recognition software connected to the sensor, attests to the integrity of the structure over the test area. If the return time varies from a previous reading obtained during an earlier inspection, the sound wave's path has been altered somewhere in the structural material. In a bridge, this could suggest that the steel contains a defect, such as a crack or corrosion, between two monitoring points. Besides buildings, bridges, and airplanes, this technology can also be used to monitor the structural health of spacecraft, pipelines, ships, and power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also developing a coating they can use to generate images of faults in structural components. This opaque "sensing skin" contains microscopic cylindrical carbon structures called carbon nanotubes. Electrical current is sent through the conductive skin from electrodes implanted along the perimeter of the painted area and a computer monitors the results. When electrical current flows through a material, it encounters resistance&amp;mdash;a measure of how much the flow of electric charge is opposed by the material. Any changes in the electrical resistance in the nanotube skin suggest the presence of a crack or other defect beneath the painted layer. The bigger a defect is, the higher the electrical resistance will be. Thus, using the collected data, the computer can visualize the resistance and generate a two-dimensional image for an inspector to review. With the push of a button, an inspector could receive a map of any area covered with the skin, and problems, no matter how small, could be pinpointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how sound can be used as a tool, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.lochness/"&gt;Sound Waves Underwater: The Loch Ness Monster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.sonar/"&gt;Sound Waves Underwater: Experiment with Sonar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn how scientists study material failure, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/psu06-nano.sci.fracture/"&gt;Bend, Twist and Break: Fracture Surfaces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about electrical currents and resistance, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/hew06.sci.phys.maf.ohmslaw/"&gt;Ohm's Law&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/viewing/0304_04_nsn.html" target="_blank"&gt;viewing ideas on NOVA Teachers&lt;/a&gt; for this video segment. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat. These gases are called greenhouse gases because they effectively form a blanket over Earth that prevents heat from escaping to space. Greenhouse gases occur naturally. However, since the industrial revolution, human activities have generated more and more of them&amp;mdash;especially carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is released as fossil fuels are consumed. As CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; becomes more concentrated in the atmosphere, it absorbs more heat. As a result, global temperature rises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists and engineers are working on ways to slow the accumulation of man-made CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. One such device, called a "scrubber," is used to capture exhaust gases from power plants. While effective, smokestack scrubbers are an expensive solution that must be installed at the source of emissions. The innovative technology featured in this video offers a different approach, one that would remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; already in the atmosphere. Synthetic trees are designed to mimic the function of natural trees, using artificial leaves to pull CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; out of the air. Unlike smokestack scrubbers, these "wind scrubbers" could be installed almost anywhere&amp;mdash;presumably at a lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To effectively capture CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the scientist and engineering team had to conceive of a "leaf" surface that would remove the most CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air, and they had to determine a leaf coating that would react with the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Because all leaves need to allow sunlight, air, and water to contact their surface for photosynthesis to occur, the location of the leaves on a plant determines how much sunlight they absorb and how air flows around them. Since synthetic leaves do not require sunlight, the team determined that their leaves could be packed much more tightly together&amp;mdash;but not so tightly as to produce too much resistance to air as it passed through them. Tests confirmed the optimal leaf configuration to contain long, flat, vertically oriented sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lackner's daughter's science project demonstrated that a hydroxide solution would remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air. When CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; comes into contact with sodium hydroxide, it binds with it, producing a liquid solution of sodium carbonate. However, because sodium hydroxide is highly corrosive, the team decided against using it to capture CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Rather, they developed a proprietary fabric material whose surface coating could attract CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; just like sodium hydroxide&amp;mdash;without the downside. Once captured, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is rinsed from the fabric for storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If realized, the synthetic tree would purportedly remove 90,000 tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; each year&amp;mdash;significantly more than a natural tree captures. While the impact of this cannot yet be known, 90,000 tons is the equivalent to the emissions of 20,000 cars in a year. However, the process of removing, isolating, and compressing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for storage is itself energy-intensive. So, unless the design team can develop a way to either reduce the amount of energy used in the process or use "cleaner" renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, to drive it, they could end up contributing to, rather than helping to resolve, the growing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pollution problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the carbon cycle, including how much carbon is stored in the atmosphere and on Earth, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.eco.ccycle/"&gt;Carbon Cycle Diagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about several potential means of storing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; captured from industrial sources, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/nsn08.sci.ess.watcyc.capcarbonint/"&gt;Capturing Carbon: Where Do We Put It?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about greenhouse gases and how they affect Earth's temperature, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.ess.watcyc.co2/"&gt;Global Warming: Carbon Dioxide and the Greenhouse Effect&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.greenhouse2/"&gt;Global Warming: The Physics of the Greenhouse Effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about another engineering breakthrough designed to curb CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/eng06.sci.engin.systems.fuelcells/"&gt;Fuel Cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/viewing/0302_03_nsn.html" target="_blank"&gt;viewing ideas on NOVA Teachers&lt;/a&gt; for this video segment. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; explains how geophysicist Klaus Lackner and two engineers, Allen and Burton Wright, teamed up to develop a technology to capture an important greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), in the air. Modeling their design after a tree&amp;mdash;and one of Lackner's daughter's science experiments&amp;mdash;the team tested different materials, configurations, and coatings that together would act as leaves do to remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air. However, instead of mimicking photosynthesis, their process uses a manufactured fabric that attracts CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and pulls it out of the air for subsequent storage. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>

      <annotation>In this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, explore options for storing carbon dioxide in order to prevent further global warming.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; reviews several potential means of storing carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) captured from industrial sources. Among the featured ideas are technologies that deliver compressed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to underground cavities, saline aquifers, and the deep seabed. The benefit of storing, or sequestering, captured CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could be significant in the fight to slow or limit global warming. However, the list of drawbacks associated with carbon sequestration includes high cost, storage capacity limitations, a still-incomplete understanding of the relevant Earth systems, and uncertainty as to whether the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be safely and permanently contained.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Through the carbon cycle, Earth captures about half of an estimated eight billion metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) produced annually through the combustion of fossil fuels. Land plants absorb CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for photosynthesis, and in the oceans, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; readily dissolves in seawater. Because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a greenhouse gas and contributes to global warming, the overwhelming consensus among scientists is that something must be done to remove most of what otherwise accumulates in the atmosphere or to reduce our combustion of fossil fuels in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many technological solutions are being explored to capture CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; either in the air or directly at an emissions source. Once collected, the gas must be safely and permanently stored to prevent its release back into the atmosphere. Before that can happen, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must be compressed. By nature, gas is expansive and more difficult to contain than a solid or liquid. Using compression, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas can be converted into a "supercritical" fluid&amp;mdash;somewhere between a gas and a liquid state. While this is both an energy-intensive and expensive process, once complete, the reformatted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be transported to a storage facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various storage solutions have been proposed, tested, and even put into limited use. They involve sites aboveground, belowground, and in the ocean. Aboveground solutions mostly rely on agricultural means to "fix" carbon in soil, while belowground solutions generally involve filling existing cavities, including depleted coal beds, oil and gas fields, or aquifers, with the fluid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Ocean storage can also take many forms, including injecting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; deep into the seabed or stimulating growth at the surface of plankton populations, which use CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While each of these options has merits, each has its drawbacks as well. Although it may be appealing to plant trees and allow vegetation to absorb CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for photosynthesis, when plants die, they release much of their stored carbon back into the atmosphere. Another approach, using alkaline minerals to react with the acidic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form stable carbonates, appears effective, but the process of mining to obtain these minerals would make it prohibitively expensive. And as large a potential storage capacity as the oceans offer, the effects of increased levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on organisms, especially benthic bottom-dwellers, is largely unknown. Existing research suggests that higher ocean acidity threatens calcium carbonate, the key structural constituent of coral skeletons and mollusk shells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other concerns about these technological solutions cited by both scientists and potential investors is the potential for leakages that could spoil freshwater supplies, and the inadequate storage capacity that most terrestrial solutions offer. And then there's the price: using present sequestration technologies, cost estimates range from $100 to $300 per ton of carbon emissions kept out of the atmosphere. All of this suggests that geological and ocean sequestration may only realistically represent one part of the solution to the problem&amp;mdash;a solution that likely must also include reducing our consumption of fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn how "synthetic trees" might one day capture CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/nsn08.sci.ess.watcyc.capcarbon/"&gt;Capturing Carbon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the carbon cycle, including how much carbon is stored in the atmosphere and on Earth, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.eco.ccycle/"&gt;Carbon Cycle Diagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about greenhouse gases and how they affect Earth's temperature, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.ess.watcyc.co2/"&gt;Global Warming: Carbon Dioxide and the Greenhouse Effect&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.greenhouse2/"&gt;Global Warming: The Physics of the Greenhouse Effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video profile adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn about geneticist and rock musician Pardis Sabeti, whose innovative insights into natural selection demonstrated how beneficial mutations spread quickly through a population.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video profile adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; profiles the life and work of Harvard geneticist and biological anthropologist Pardis Sabeti. Although Sabeti spends many of her evenings on stage, fronting her band Thousand Days, her true passion is unraveling scientific puzzles. In 2006, Sabeti developed a method for analyzing the human genome in search of genes that may have arisen through natural selection. Her method is now widely used among geneticists and evolutionary biologists in an effort to better understand how genetic traits have evolved.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Evolution and genetics once seemed worlds apart. While evolutionary biologists generally charted the paths that organisms had taken in the past, geneticists attempted to catalogue the present state of a species' genetic makeup, often with the aim of curing some human diseases in the future. By developing a system to analyze genetic information through an evolutionary lens, Harvard scientist Pardis Sabeti has helped to bridge the divide between these two scientific disciplines. Now she hopes that these new tools may one day help eliminate some of the world's deadliest diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have known for more than a century that evolution proceeds through a process of natural selection. Traits that are beneficial to an organism and improve that individual's chances of survival and reproduction are more likely to be passed on to future generations. Traits that are detrimental to survival are less likely to be passed on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of genes and their relation to an organism's traits and to inheritance was first suggested by Gregor Mendel in the 1860s, based on his studies of pea plants. Despite tremendous advances since then in our understanding of what genes are and how they function, the way in which genes are selected for and become more common in a population has remained something of a mystery. In addition, hypotheses regarding the path of evolutionary change have proven difficult to test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pardis Sabeti helped to resolve these two mysteries by developing a method to analyze the human genome in search of the signs of natural selection. Although the genetic difference between one person and the next is a scant 0.01 percent, the differences that exist can be telling. Scientists think that common genetic variations that have arisen relatively recently are clear signs of the work of natural selection. The method that Sabeti developed analyzes such common variations to determine how long ago they arose in the population. In this way, she has identified several variations that have likely been favored by evolution. As an example, Sabeti points to the mutation that causes sickle cell anemia. Although this mutation causes disease in people who inherit a copy from both parents, it offers malarial resistance to individuals who possess only one copy. Indeed, Sabeti found that the sickle cell mutation became prevalent quite recently in evolutionary terms in regions were malaria is prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sabeti has more recently turned the focus of her analysis from human evolution to the evolution of disease-causing organisms, including the parasite that causes malaria. She hopes that by identifying regions of a parasite's genome that have been favored by evolution, the analysis might also reveal genetic vulnerabilities that could be more effectively targeted by medicine. The malaria parasite and many other disease-causing microorganisms have proven their ability to adapt quickly and become resistant to medications used to fight them. Sabeti's hope is that by identifying a vulnerability in this process, scientists will one day be better able to fight, and perhaps eliminate, diseases including malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the connection between natural selection and genetics, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.variation/"&gt;Genetic Variation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.comgencode/"&gt;The Common Genetic Code&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/hew06.sci.life.gen.mendelinherit/"&gt;Mendel's Laws of Genetic Inheritance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/hew06.sci.life.gen.dominantgene/"&gt;Some Genes Are Dominant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the evolution of the sickle cell mutation in response to malaria, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.mutationstory/"&gt;A Mutation Story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the rapid evolution of microorganisms, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.microbeclock/"&gt;Microbe Clock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, follow the scientific process that led to a revolutionary method for creating stem cells without the use of human embryos.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; tells the story behind one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs in the past decade. Human embryonic stem cells, once thought to be the key to curing countless debilitating diseases, have sparked a decade-long firestorm of ethical and political debate in the United States that has greatly curtailed their use in scientific research and medical therapies. Now a revolutionary method of creating stem cells&amp;mdash;without embryos&amp;mdash;may pave the way to swifter progress in the effort to understand and cure diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Unlike most of the other cell types in the human body, stem cells are "pluripotent," meaning they have the capacity to become any of the 220 specialized cell types in our bodies, given the right set of genetic cues. Many experts think that harnessing this potential is the key to curing dozens of diseases. From stem cells, scientists hope to create populations of diseased brain cells that can be studied to better understand how diseases like Huntington's or Alzheimer's disease develop, and to create healthy cells of many types to replace patients' diseased cells and tissues. But stem cells are difficult to come by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before 2007, embryos gathered from in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics were the only viable source of human stem cells. Many people consider their collection, which destroys the embryo, morally wrong, and in 1995, the U.S. government prohibited federal funding of such research. In addition, creating patient-specific stem cells was once thought to require cloning, a process that is also morally and politically fraught. In this process, the DNA from a patient's cell is placed into a human egg cell from which the DNA has been removed. The stem cells that result when the egg develops contain genetic material identical to the patient's. These cells could, hypothetically, be used to replace diseased cells in that individual if human cloning were not so controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it was an observation of the cloning process that initially led Japanese scientist Shinya Yamanaka to a revolutionary method of creating stem cells that could obviate the need for both embryos and cloning in stem cell research. Yamanaka knew that, in cloning, the insertion of DNA from a specialized adult cell, such as a skin cell, into an egg cell causes the specialized cell's DNA to be reprogrammed. The skin cell's genes are turned off and stem cell genes are turned on. Although exactly what causes this transformation remains unknown, Yamanaka went off in search of a set of stem cell control genes&amp;mdash;a small set, he hoped&amp;mdash;that could be used to reprogram cells through means other than cloning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yamanaka narrowed the list of possible genes from 100 to 4 using a painstaking process of elimination and so-called "knockout" mice. Knockouts are genetically programmed so that one gene is nonfunctional. By observing the physiological effects of the genetic difference in a group of knockout mice, scientists can deduce what role that gene might play in organisms with a functional gene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Yamanaka had identified a set of genes that seemed to be involved in stem cell programming, he set out to test his candidates by inserting them into the skin cells of mice. To do this, he used viruses in a technique that is now standard practice in genetics labs. Viruses have evolved a way of packaging and inserting genes into host cells. Often this causes disease, but scientists have found a way to engineer viruses to carry genes of other animals, including mice and humans. The viruses Yamanaka used had been engineered to carry the four genes that he thought were involved in stem cell programming. Indeed, when the viruses had done their work on a population of skin cells, the transformation from specialized skin cell to pluripotent stem cells was quick&amp;mdash;and the path toward stem cell treatments and cures suddenly became clearer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the science and controversy behind stem cell research, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.cell.stemcellvid/"&gt;Stem Cells: Seeds of Hope?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.cell.stemweb/"&gt;Stem Cell Debate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how cells differentiate, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.stru.different/"&gt;Cell Differentiation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explore in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/0305_03_nsn.html" target="blank"&gt;NOVA scienceNOW classroom activity&lt;/a&gt; how stem cells become specialized cells.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; profiles Luis von Ahn, the computer scientist and award-winning college professor behind innovations to prevent e-mail spam and digitize rare books.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, meet Luis von Ahn, a computer scientist and a professor at Carnegie Mellon who is already at the top of his field at age thirty. Learn about one of his most successful ideas&amp;mdash;CAPTCHA&amp;mdash;a test that humans can pass but computers cannot, which has been used to improve the security of Internet sites. Explore how he comes up with his innovative ideas, and how CAPTCHAs have been reinvented to help digitize old books.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;You have probably solved at least one CAPTCHA&amp;mdash;a distorted word image that users are asked to decode on Web sites, such as when registering a new email address or posting to a site. Solving a CAPTCHA is a relatively easy task for humans, who have the ability to recognize distorted letters and numbers. However, it is nearly impossible for a computer to figure out the answer. As a result, this innovative test allows valid users access to Web services, while protecting the services from being abused by automated computer programs designed by spammers with malicious intent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although perhaps best known for developing CAPTCHAs, the computer scientist Luis von Ahn has many other interesting ideas. For example, he has also developed "Games With A Purpose" (GWAP)&amp;mdash;computer games that humans play for fun but that also accomplish useful computing tasks. Since people tend to spend quite a bit of time playing video games, Luis von Ahn wanted to try to harness all that "wasted" time to produce something beneficial for society. The games that he develops serve the purpose of training computers and improving information content on the Internet. For example, in his ESP game, two users are randomly paired together and shown the same image. The goal of the game is to describe the picture using words that the other player also chooses. When both players type the same word, they earn points and get a new image. This game helps label pictures with appropriate descriptive words for use in search engines. The game has been licensed to Google (as Google Image Labeler) and is currently being used to improve the quality of Google's image search results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of GWAPs that are similar in purpose to the ESP game. In Tag a Tune, players describe what they hear in an audio recording; in Popvideo, players describe what they see and hear in video clips; and in Verbosity, players work together to collect common sense descriptions of words. Other games are meant to train computers in a more abstract sense. For example, in Matchin, players rate images according to attractiveness, to teach computers what humans view as beautiful. In Squigl, players outline objects in images&amp;mdash;this program is being used to improve computer vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When thinking of ways to make use of the time millions of people spend online, Luis von Ahn has certainly conceived of some exciting projects. Of course, he fully admits that not all of his ideas are good. In fact, he claims that the vast majority of his ideas are bad, especially since he comes up with so many ideas every day. He recognizes good ideas by letting them stew for a while. If he's still thinking about an idea a few months later, then maybe it actually is a good one. And if it's a good idea, maybe it's worth working on it some more to make it a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; idea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about computer science, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/city07.sci.engin.design.jara/"&gt;Eduardo Torres-Jara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/eng06.sci.engin.design.kismet/"&gt;Kismet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about technology and society, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.engin.design.techsociety/"&gt;The Impact of Technology: Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about careers in engineering, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/eng06.sci.engin.systems.engoptions/"&gt;Engineering Career Options&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What was Luis von Ahn's great idea for thwarting spammers? How does it work? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does Luis von Ahn come up with his ideas?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think Luis von Ahn wanted to work at the university as a professor and not for a computer company? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would you consider Luis von Ahn a scientist? Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; profiles Franklin Chang-D&amp;iacute;az, a scientist who is working on plasma-powered rockets and was NASA's first Latin American astronaut.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, meet Franklin Chang-D&amp;iacute;az, an astronaut and scientist. Learn how he has been interested in rockets and space travel since he was a child in Costa Rica, and how he immigrated to the United States to pursue his dream of becoming an astronaut. Hear how he found success in school and eventually was chosen as NASA's first Latin American astronaut. In addition, find out about a new type of rocket that he is developing, which uses a plasma engine, and may help one day facilitate human colonization of the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Since childhood, Franklin Chang-D&amp;iacute;az has been interested in space exploration. He achieved his dream to travel in space by becoming NASA's first Latin American astronaut and has since flown in space seven times. He continues to pursue his other dream, which he has also had since childhood: to improve methods of space travel. He is now making progress toward the development of a new type of rocket technology&amp;mdash;the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR)&amp;mdash;that would use plasma to revolutionize space travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rockets are propelled by the expulsion of material in the opposite direction from the desired flight trajectory. Conventional rockets use a chemical reaction (the combustion of fuel) to produce exhaust that is expelled out the back of the rocket, pushing the rocket forward. The VASIMR system would use plasma&amp;mdash;a state of matter that is created when a gas is heated to such high temperature that its electrons break free from its atoms. Very high velocity exhaust material can be produced by the extremely high heat of the plasma, which means that less propellant is needed to create an adequate amount of thrust. In conventional rockets, the fuel accounts for most of the mass of the system (which doesn't allow for the rocket to carry much else), and it is not very efficient; a conventional rocket would take about seven months to reach Mars. In contrast, a plasma-powered rocket could carry bigger payloads and would be able to travel to Mars in just 40 days!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VASIMR has three basic steps. First, low frequency electromagnetic waves and a magnetic field work together to heat a neutral gas, such as argon, until it becomes plasma. Next, electromagnetic waves further energize the plasma to higher temperature. Finally, magnetic fields act as a "magnetic nozzle" to direct the motion of the plasma, converting its energy into thrust to propel the rocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Franklin Chang-D&amp;iacute;az first envisioned this new type of rocket while he was a graduate student studying applied plasma physics. He dreamed of a future where space travel was fast and efficient enough that humans could populate the solar system. With a plasma-powered rocket, interplanetary travel times would be short enough that it could even be possible to explore the entire solar system and create colonies on the Moon. Although the technology has not yet been developed to achieve this dream in the near future&amp;mdash;for example, no one has yet developed a nuclear reactor for use in space, a prerequisite technology needed to generate the electrical power for the engine&amp;mdash;Franklin Chang-D&amp;iacute;az is making progress. The first step toward this new future of space travel will be to create a less powerful version of the engine that could be powered by solar electricity for use near Earth and the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about plasma, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/lsps07.sci.phys.matter.naturematter/"&gt;Particulate Nature of Matter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.solarwind/"&gt;Solar Wind's Effect on Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about space exploration, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.eor/"&gt;How Do You Get to the Moon?&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.exptimeline/"&gt;Robotic Exploration of Space Timeline&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/oer08.sci.engin.systems.elevator/"&gt;A Nanotube Space Elevator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about astronauts, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.astronauts/"&gt;Expedition 8 Crew Talks to Students in Japan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about careers in engineering, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/eng06.sci.engin.systems.engoptions/"&gt;Engineering Career Options&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; describes a team of scientists searching for evidence of ancient life within a salt deposit that formed 250 million years ago.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, take a trip to an underground salt deposit that formed 250 million years ago to search for evidence of ancient life. Learn about the formation of the salt deposit and observe as scientists drill into the salt walls to retrieve samples. See liquids trapped within the salt that are millions of years old, and hear from scientists who were stunned to find that there were fibers of ancient cellulose inside.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Earth's geologic history is recorded in its layers of rock&amp;mdash;each layer contains information about the climate, life, and conditions at the time of its formation. Sedimentary rock is formed by the deposition of organic or inorganic sediments or the precipitation of minerals from a solution. As sedimentary layers are deposited one over another, they keep a time-sequenced record of Earth's history; the oldest layers are at the bottom and the youngest layers at are the top. Within these layers of rock, fossils provide indirect evidence of ancient life. The original organic materials of these ancient living things have long since been destroyed, but fossilized remains&amp;mdash;essentially rock formed into the shape of the organic material&amp;mdash;help scientists piece together an understanding of Earth's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Salado Formation in New Mexico (featured in the video segment) is composed primarily of the mineral halite, commonly known as rock salt, deposited about 250 million years ago during the Permian period. It is a large salt bed, about 200 feet underground, which was formed by the evaporation of salty water; it is evidence that there was once a large body of salty water covering the area. As the water evaporated and the salt crystallized, some pockets of liquid solution were trapped within the salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These liquid inclusions (an inclusion is material that becomes trapped inside a mineral during formation) are providing scientists with a surprising view into the past: in contrast to the indirect evidence provided by fossilized remains, they contain &lt;em&gt;direct&lt;/em&gt; evidence of life. Due to the low permeability of the deposit, samples carefully collected from the salt are uncontaminated. These samples contain the same materials that were deposited 250 million years ago! Amazingly, scientists have found intact cellulose molecules hidden in the pockets of liquid, unaltered from their original form. Cellulose is a common organic compound found in plants and algae, and produced by some bacteria. The ancient cellulose fibers found within the salt deposit behave just like modern cellulose: they look the same and they react the same way to particular enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, scientists have found some small fragments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). It is extremely unusual for organic materials to survive over such a long time period, but apparently the DNA was preserved by the salty environment. Scientists hope to be able to further study this ancient DNA to learn more about where it came from and what the DNA of living organisms was like so many millions of years ago. These original organic materials provide a unique opportunity to perform biological tests to study ancient life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about another possible discovery of ancient biological materials, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/oer09.sci.life.gen.trexblood/"&gt;T.

      <annotation>In this video from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn how scientists detect potential signs of life on distant planets.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; examines how scientists are investigating the possibility of finding life on other planets. The video focuses on the techniques used to analyze light and heat signals from faraway planets to determine their atmospheric composition. It also explains how scientists use an understanding of the requirements of life of Earth&amp;mdash;past and present&amp;mdash;to guide their search for extraterrestrial life. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Sophisticated remote-sensing technology aids scientists in their quest for life on far-off planets. Telescopes measure how these planets reflect both the visible light and heat of their stars, which can reveal the chemical makeup of the planets' atmospheres. Some scientists believe that this information can confirm whether the planets have telltale "fingerprints," or specific blends of chemicals, that could potentially support life&amp;mdash;at least life as we know it to exist on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these scientists don't just consider the atmospheric makeup that supports the types of life that exist on Earth today. Along with the life that has inhabited it, Earth's atmosphere has also evolved. Scientists think that it was completely oxygen-free for the first 2 billion years or so. In fact, the gases that made up our initial atmosphere, including the carbon dioxide and ammonia compounds that came from ancient volcanic eruptions, would be toxic to most of today's life forms. It wasn't until about 2.5 billion years ago that primitive blue-green bacteria began producing oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. Once the oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere, an ozone layer formed. Concentrated ozone shields Earth from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet rays, allowing life to survive on land. Once terrestrial plants started to flourish, Earth's atmosphere began to change to the oxygen-rich blend that exists today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Earth's atmosphere has supported different kinds of life as it has evolved demonstrates that the presence of atmospheric oxygen isn't a prerequisite for a planet to support life. In fact, scientists generally point to carbon as being more fundamental to life. Carbon is the molecular basis of amino acids&amp;mdash;life's building blocks. Among life's other essentials is the presence of liquid water, or some other fluid medium in which chemical reactions can occur. Within our solar system, Earth is the only planet whose atmosphere regulates temperatures such that liquid water can exist on its surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earth's oldest discovered cellular fossils were single-celled bacteria&amp;mdash;just about the simplest of all life forms, but ones that would later diversify and evolve into multicellular organisms. Knowledge of the wide range of conditions in which microbes flourish on Earth also guides scientists as they consider where life might exist elsewhere within the solar system. For example, so-called "extremophiles" are organisms that inhabit environments with conditions at temperatures, pressures, and pH more extreme than those typically found on Earth's surface. These environments include caves containing highly acidic hydrogen sulfide in the air, and deep-sea vents, where the water reaches temperatures of 375&amp;deg;C (707&amp;deg;F), and is rich in dissolved minerals, including iron. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the search for life on other planetary bodies, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.otherplanets/"&gt;A Strange New Planet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.planetsearch/"&gt;The Search for Another Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how and where life might have originated on Earth, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.ess.earthsys.deepseavents/"&gt;Deep-Sea Vents and Life's Origins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.ess.earthsys.stetteroxy/"&gt;Life Before Oxygen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.lifecondtn/"&gt;Caves: Extreme Conditions for Life&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/nsn09.sci.life.eco.seafloor/"&gt;Exploring the Arctic Seafloor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about carbon-based life, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.carbon/"&gt;Ingredients for Life: Carbon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about what life requires, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.lifeessential/"&gt;Life's Little Essential: Liquid Water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.water/"&gt;Ingredients for Life: Water&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain the evidence that scientists use to infer the presence of carbon dioxide, water, methane, or ozone in the atmosphere of another planet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do scientists examine absorption spectra to try to identify extraterrestrial life? What assumption are they making when they use this technique?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is meant by a "golden fingerprint"? Why is there a different fingerprint for different times in Earth's history?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it possible that life forms can be found on planets with very different atmospheric compositions than that of Earth?

      <annotation>In this interactive activity adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn what some of the first imagery ever shot on the Arctic Ocean seabed tells us about life in extreme environments.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Take a virtual expedition deep under the Arctic ice along with a research team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in this interactive activity adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;. Through two collections of photos and video footage, learn about the obstacles the team faced at the frozen sea surface, as well as the geological and biological discoveries deep down near the Gakkel Ridge, an 1,100-mile-long section of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. There, volcanic activity generates new ocean crust, and the combination of chemical reactions and lack of sunlight supports a web of unusual life forms. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;It's no wonder that the bottom of the Arctic Ocean is considered to be one of Earth's last frontiers. Much of the year it is located under thick ice in a remote location, making it difficult and expensive for research teams to plan expeditions. Even without these logistical challenges, the depth and darkness of the frigid water make exploration even more daunting. But with the use of an icebreaker, a team of researchers from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution set out in 2007 to explore the Gakkel Ridge, part of the mid-ocean ridge system that runs almost directly below the North Pole. They used cutting-edge submersible vehicles to document in pictures and video the geology and biology of this undersea feature for the very first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Earth's mid-ocean ridges, hot rock from Earth's core is forced up to the seafloor's surface and new ocean floor forms in a process known as seafloor spreading. It's here, too, that the emerging molten rock produces formations called vents, or chimneys. Scientists study these features to better understand geological processes, in particular aspects of plate tectonics. But they also seek to learn more about deep-sea communities that live around these vents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gakkel Ridge has been geologically isolated from other mid-ocean ridges for more than 20 million years. This isolation has long intrigued scientists. Team researchers learned from a 2001 expedition that Gakkel Ridge rocks are made of mantle rock, which is different than the basalt rock found at other known mid-ocean ridges in the world. Scientists suspect that the chemical reactions between the Gakkel Ridge rocks and seawater may produce a different mix of chemicals&amp;mdash;one that would in turn support the unique forms of life discovered there. In fact, because the Gakkel Ridge rocks were thought to be similar in composition to rocks that emerged billions of years ago, early on in Earth's history, researchers suspect life at these Arctic vents may provide clues to the earliest life on our planet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's been discovered at deep-sea ridges like the Gakkel Ridge offers a clear lesson in how geology drives biology; that is, that the physical conditions dictate the kinds of life that evolve. Through a process called chemosynthesis, bacteria use energy stored in the mix of chemicals around them to grow and multiply. These bacteria, then, are equivalent to land plants, which derive energy from sunlight and serve as the base of the terrestrial food web. In the absence of sunlight, deep-sea bacteria derive the energy to support life from reactions between oxygen and abundant chemical compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonia. Larger, more complex organisms either live on the bacteria that grow in their bodies or they feed on each other. As is confirmed by the still images and video footage in this interactive activity, a variety of vent life has evolved to take advantage of this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how and where life might have originated on Earth, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.ess.earthsys.deepseavents/"&gt;Deep-Sea Vents and Life's Origins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.ess.earthsys.stetteroxy/"&gt;Life Before Oxygen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.lifecondtn/"&gt;Caves: Extreme Conditions for Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about plate tectonics, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.tectonic/"&gt;Tectonic Plates, Earthquakes, and Volcanoes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.shake/"&gt;Mountain Maker, Earth Shaker&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.boundaries/"&gt;Tectonic Plates and Plate Boundaries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about undersea scientific exploration at the South Pole, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ipy09.sci.life.eco.scini/"&gt;Studying the Antarctic Sea Floor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why did the scientists believe that the Gakkel Ridge might have unique life forms not found in any other extreme environment? Name some of the life forms that were identified in this expedition. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;During the expedition, scientists discovered the remains of colonies of sea sponges. Why do you think the colonies might have all died at the same time? What questions can you think of that you'd like to investigate?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why did they expect the ecosystem around the Gakkel Ridge's hydrothermal vents to be very different from terrestrial systems? What do you think is the most fundamental difference between terrestrial and hydrothermal ecosystems? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From what you've seen and read, how does the biology of the Gakkel Ridge help scientists understand the geology, and vice versa?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; explores whether animals and humans are more similar than we think. Meet Rio, a sea lion who demonstrates to researchers reasoning skills once thought limited to humans.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, meet Rio, a captive California sea lion who has helped research biologists to better understand the cognitive abilities of this species. See how Rio has learned that certain sounds are associated with certain letters or numbers, and observe how she demonstrates the higher order reasoning skill of logic. Biologist Colleen Reichmuth explains how Rio has learned that all letters can be grouped together and is able to use a logic rule to solve a new problem. Consider how this reasoning ability is related to language.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;People have long pondered what distinguishes humans from other animals. Over the years, philosophers have pointed to the ability to make and use tools, as well as the use of language. However, research has since shown that a variety of species use tools. For example, other primates have been observed using sticks to collect ants and termites and using stones to help crack nuts, and birds have been observed fashioning hooks out of wire to help them retrieve food. The question remains: Are advanced mental abilities&amp;mdash;such as thinking and language&amp;mdash;skills that are unique to humans?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no doubt that animals communicate with one another, studies have yet to demonstrate a language among animals that is comparable to human language. Some animals have been taught to communicate with humans and seem to be able to understand words and communicate with sign language. Still, the question remains: Were these subjects really thinking symbolically or had they merely been trained by rote memorization? What &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; to be communication could simply be mimicry and the result of conditioning by a reward system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have set out to observe whether nonhuman animals have the capacity for the abstract thinking that is the basis of language. For instance, chimpanzees and dolphins have demonstrated an understanding of grammar&amp;mdash;depending on the order of words in the command, the animal was able to place or retrieve a specified object in a specified location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study presented in this video demonstrates that a sea lion has the ability to form logical relationships between symbols (such as sounds, letters, and numbers). For example, Rio has been taught that the sound of a telephone ring is equivalent to the letter "B" and also that all letters are equivalent to each other. When presented with a novel problem that she had not seen before, Rio is able to make the logical jump that the sound of the telephone (typically paired with the letter "B") could be paired with any other letter. In other words, Rio is able to figure out that if X=Y, and Y=Z, then X=Z. This type of logical conclusion demonstrates a thought process, not simply a behavior modified by training. This ability to recognize equivalence may be a precursor to language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wild, such reasoning skills likely help sea lions make decisions critical to their survival. For example, by associating sights, sounds, and smells, sea lions can learn to keep track of various interactions, such as how to recognize friends and family members and avoid enemies and predators, and where to find food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about animal communication, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.reg.beenavig/"&gt;Bee Navigation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.reg.dancebee/"&gt;Dances with Bees&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about animal behavior, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/nat08.living.reg.resou.roost/"&gt;The Roost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/klvx08.sci.klvxdolph/"&gt;Dolphin Reproductive Behavior&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about animal intelligence, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/nat08.living.reg.resou.testintel/"&gt;Testing Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/nat08.living.reg.resou.feeding/"&gt;Feeding Time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the "reasoning" task that Colleen planned for Rio. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you think this is a simple or complicated reasoning task? At what age do you think a human could reason in a similar way? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Give an example of how this kind of reasoning is used in everyday life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In what ways are the skills that Rio demonstrates related to language?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you agree with the scientist's statement that there are no traits that are uniquely human? Or, in other words, that there are no traits that are not shared to a greater or lesser degree with other animals? Explain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, find out how cars made of a material stronger than steel and half the weight can help combat climate change.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, hear physicist and energy expert Amory Lovins explain how to make more efficient cars by making them lighter and more aerodynamic. Explore how the use of carbon fiber can reduce weight without reducing size or durability, and learn about some manufacturing challenges associated with using carbon fiber materials.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The use of fuel in cars produces a significant amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere and has been implicated in global climate change. Cars that are designed to be more efficient&amp;mdash;able to travel farther per unit of fuel&amp;mdash;could help to reduce greenhouse emissions. For example, if cars were lighter, the efficiency of the cars could be greatly increased. As technologies improve, the future holds promise for building lighter cars using a material known as a carbon fiber composite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Composite materials are made from two or more component materials: a "matrix" material surrounds a "reinforcement" material to form a new material with special properties. In the case of carbon fiber composites (often referred to simply as carbon fiber), a matrix material of resin (a substance that hardens with treatment) surrounds threads of carbon to produce a material that is incredibly strong and light. Because of its high ratio of strength to weight&amp;mdash;carbon fiber is just as strong, or stronger, than steel at about one-fifth the weight&amp;mdash;carbon fiber is used in a variety of products including tennis rackets, bicycles, airplanes, boats, and race cars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways to produce filaments of carbon; however, the current raw materials and methods used to synthesize the fibers are costly. As a result, carbon fiber is expensive, about $8&amp;ndash;10 per pound; comparatively, steel costs less than $1 per pound. In addition, the process of fashioning carbon fibers into a product is relatively complicated and difficult to mass-produce. Consequently, products made from carbon fiber composites are more expensive than similar products made from more traditional materials. The cost of building a car from carbon fiber composites is still too high to be practical, but researchers are investigating new methods to produce carbon fibers in the hopes of reducing the cost of the material. Researchers are also developing new techniques for molding parts out of carbon fibers so that they can be mass-produced at an affordable price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of new manufacturing processes is not the only challenge; the recycling of carbon fiber is a more complex process than that of recycling steel. Carbon fiber composites are recycled by breaking them down and reclaiming the shortened fibers; new carbon fiber composites made from recycled carbon fiber are generally less strong than the original material, but they are still useful for many applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about carbon materials, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/oer08.sci.engin.systems.elevator/"&gt;A Nanotube Space Elevator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.sparkle/"&gt;Diamonds: The Science Behind the Sparkle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about materials science, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.engin.design.technylon/"&gt;The Impact of Technology: Nylon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.elements/"&gt;Elements of Steel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.bbmatrls/"&gt;Materials Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about car safety and design, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.engin.design.techcars/"&gt;The Impact of Technology: Cars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/eng06.sci.engin.systems.airbag/"&gt;Air Bag Design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about energy use and technology, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.eco.energyuse/"&gt;Snapshot of US Energy Use&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.hydrogencar/"&gt;Global Warming: The Hydrogen Car&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider ways to decrease a city's carbon footprint in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3507_car.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the environmental effects of so many cars on the roads, as seen in the beginning of the video? Brainstorm ways to address some of these issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From 1987 to 2007, the average fuel efficiency of all cars on the road actually decreased from 22.0 mpg to 20.2 mpg. Explain why this decrease occurred, even though engines today are more efficient. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;List at least three ways you can think of to increase the efficiency of cars. Are there steps an ordinary person can take to make this happen?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe carbon fiber. What are the pros and cons of using it to make cars?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What environmental impact would this technology have on our lives if it were available today? How would the production of this prototype impact car manufacturing? What other options are presently available to reduce the problems presented in the video? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, find out about the discovery of a new building material, the carbon nanotube, whose physical properties could theoretically enable the creation of a 22,000-mile elevator to space.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, explore the potential of carbon nanotubes, whose strength and unique properties make them useful for a variety of applications. See animations of how carbon atoms bond to one another in different ways to make diamond, graphite, buckyballs, and nanotubes, and observe one method that is being researched to form and assemble carbon nanotubes into a long ribbon. Consider how a seemingly impossible application, such as an elevator from the surface of Earth to space, is now theoretically possible given this revolutionary new building material. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The chemical element carbon is one the most abundant elements in the universe. The structure of carbon lends itself to make millions of different compounds; it has four valence electrons, allowing it to bond with up to four other atoms at a time. In one form of carbon&amp;mdash;graphite&amp;mdash;each carbon atom is bonded to three other carbon atoms in a plane of hexagonal rings; the bonds within the plane are extremely strong, even stronger than in diamond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in the late 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, a great deal of research has been focused on fullerenes, a form of carbon that is similar in structure to the plane of hexagonal rings in a single layer of graphite, but formed into shapes such as hollow spheres (buckyballs) and cylinders (nanotubes). In particular, carbon nanotubes, which are essentially tiny tubes of carbon with a diameter of just about a nanometer (a billionth of a meter), have exceptional properties that seem to give them unlimited potential for use. They are incredibly strong and light; compared to steel, carbon nanotubes have a far greater tensile strength (a measure of how much a material can be stretched until it breaks) at a fraction of the density. In addition, carbon nanotubes can have a range of electrical and thermal properties, making them useful for a variety of applications, such as composite materials, computers, electronics, optics, and biotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One potential use for carbon nanotubes may be as part of an elevator from Earth to space. Although it sounds like a fantastical idea of fiction, such an elevator may very well be possible. The concept itself is relatively simple&amp;mdash;imagine a long cable that is anchored to Earth and connects to an orbiting object in space; if the cable is taut, vehicles could climb it, transporting people and other objects into space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order for the cable to remain in place, it would be tethered to a location near the equator and would extend through geostationary orbit (about 22,000 miles above Earth's surface) to a counterweight in space. If the center of gravity of the structure is at geostationary orbit, where objects orbit the planet at exactly the same rate at which Earth rotates, the elevator system will stay in the same position relative to a fixed point on Earth's surface. The cable would be held taut similar to the way a ball on a string extends away from your hand as you rotate the string. If the upper end of the cable in space is moving faster than the velocity needed to maintain orbit, it moves outward away from the planet, pulling the cable taut; as Earth rotates, the tension of the cable provides the centripetal force to keep the counterweight in orbit. Because the cable would be extremely long, it would need to be made of a material that is both extraordinarily strong and light. No such material yet exists, but carbon nanotubes may provide a solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the chemistry of carbon, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.carbon/"&gt;Ringed-Carbon Compounds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.sparkle/"&gt;Diamonds: The Science Behind the Sparkle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about centripetal force, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/lsps07.sci.phys.maf.circmotion/"&gt;Circular Motion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about orbits, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.earthorbit/"&gt;Satellites Orbiting Earth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.essatellites/"&gt;Earth System: Satellites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about materials, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.engin.design.technylon/"&gt;The Impact of Technology: Nylon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.elements/"&gt;Elements of Steel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/viewing/3401_02_nsn.html" target="_blank"&gt;viewing ideas on NOVA Teachers&lt;/a&gt; for this video segment. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, microbiologist Bonnie Bassler shares her discovery that bacteria coordinate group activity by communicating through chemical signals.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; explains a process called quorum sensing, which enables bacteria to detect other bacteria of the same species in their surrounding environment. With enough bacteria present, they can undertake a group activity, such as producing a luminescent glow or spreading disease. Professor Bonnie Bassler and her team of researchers recently discovered that certain bacteria communicate not only to their own species but to other species around them. This work may help pave the way to new drug treatments that combat bacterial diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Bacteria are relatively primitive one-celled organisms called prokaryotes. Prokaryotic cells lack the nucleus and organelles of more sophisticated eukaryotic cells, which are found in plants and animals. Although bacteria cluster to form colonies, each cell can live independently of the others&amp;mdash;unlike multi-celled organisms, whose highly specialized cells cannot survive on their own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, scientists thought that a bacterial colony conferred no specific survival advantage to its individual members. However, recent research suggests something quite to the contrary. Through a process called quorum sensing, bacterial cells appear to communicate in a way that enables a kind of strategic coordination more commonly ascribed to social animals such as ants and humans. This cell-to-cell communication occurs not through language but through the release of chemical-signaling molecules called autoinducers. When bacteria release autoinducers into an environment and their signal is received by other quorum-sensing bacteria, the group can exhibit a genetically programmed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bioluminescence is one such behavior. In the natural world, luminescent bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Vibrio fischeri&lt;/em&gt; inhabit Pacific bobtail squid. Because moonlight casts visible shadows on the sand floor, these squid are vulnerable to predators. The squid and the bacteria, in a symbiotic relationship, compensate for this by glowing to match the moonlit water in color and intensity; the quorum-sensing bacteria produce this glow from inside their host. With their host protected, the bacteria are protected as well. While an individual bacterium can do little on its own to produce change around it, a group of coordinated cells can produce behaviors that afford a colony an evolutionary advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research suggests that quorum sensing occurs among many bacterial species. In fact, it might be the mechanism that enables pathogenic, or disease-causing, species to multiply, concentrate, and overpower a body's immune system, thereby establishing infection in a host. Although antibiotics exist to combat many infections, some bacterial strains have developed a resistance to the treatments through repeated exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of rising resistance to existing drugs, pharmaceutical researchers are looking for ways to use their understanding of quorum sensing to control disease. One approach is to disrupt cell-to-cell communications by blocking the receptors that bacteria use to receive the molecular signals. If researchers can find a way to prevent bacteria from communicating, they may be able to effectively combat diseases caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how "social" animals communicate with one another, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.reg.beenavig/"&gt;Bee Navigation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.reg.dancebee/"&gt;Dances with Bees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is quorum sensing? What adaptive advantage does it confer to a colony? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;According to the video, bacteria release two types of molecules. What different roles do these molecules play?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you know about bacteria and the role of bacteria in disease?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why does the phenomenon of quorum sensing in bacteria come as a surprise to scientists? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, meet researchers who are studying obesity and trying to understand the role that hormones and genetics can play in regulating appetite.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn about obesity and how both genetics and behavior play a role in its development. Obesity researchers Sadaf Forooqi, Stephen O'Rahilly, and Jeffrey Friedman discuss the physiological basis of appetite regulation, including the roles of the hormone leptin, which suppresses hunger, and the melanocortin 4-receptor, or MC4R, which processes the message to control appetite. The relative importance of a healthy diet and exercise is also emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Obesity is a condition in which body weight and body fat are greater than what is considered healthy for a given height. Body mass index (BMI)&amp;mdash;calculated as a person's weight (in kilograms) divided by height squared (in square meters)&amp;mdash;is a quick and simple way to estimate the amount of body fat, although it is not very accurate. Obesity is commonly defined as having a BMI greater than 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a high BMI can be a serious health hazard; obesity is associated with high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, diabetes, heart disease, respiratory problems, and some cancers. Unfortunately, the prevalence of obesity has risen to epidemic proportions over the past couple of decades. In the United States, the majority of adults are overweight and over 30 percent are categorized as obese. Childhood obesity has also become more common&amp;mdash;approximately 15 percent of children and adolescents are obese&amp;mdash;which has led to an increase in the incidence of health problems that were once rare among children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of obesity. Individuals with varying genetic predispositions may respond differently to the same environmental conditions; for example, some people may be genetically disposed to overeat or to store body fat more easily. In other words, within a population of people who share similar environmental and behavioral conditions (such as food quality and physical activity), there will be a range of body types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The influence of genes on obesity is strong; there is evidence that 70&amp;ndash;80 percent of the variation among individuals in body fatness is due to genetic factors. Furthermore, specific genes have been discovered to be associated with obesity. For example, a small percentage of people (estimated to be about one in 1,000) have a genetic mutation that affects the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R)&amp;mdash;a receptor in the brain that receives signals to regulate appetite via the hormone leptin. This genetic mutation changes the surface of MC4R so that it is unable to process the message to control hunger. As a result, people with an MC4R mutation are more susceptible to obesity because their brains do not receive the signal to suppress the urge to eat. With no signal to tell them that they are full, they continue to feel hungry even after their body no longer needs additional energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the genetic influence is only part of the story&amp;mdash;lifestyle is also critically important in contributing to obesity. The recent increase in the percentage of people categorized as obese cannot be attributed to genetic changes that favor obesity (genetic changes of populations occur much more slowly); the increase in obesity is more likely a result of sedentary lifestyles and calorie-rich diets that cause an energy imbalance. Body weight is maintained by consuming as many calories as are used, and a balanced diet of healthy foods contributes to overall health. Current lifestyles often support excess calorie consumption and not enough physical activity, which result in weight gain and poorer health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about appetite, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/hew06.sci.life.reg.eating/"&gt;The Science Behind Appetite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about nutrition, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.colt.bodyneedsweb/"&gt;Body Needs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about genetics, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/lsps07.sci.life.gen.whatisdna/"&gt;Genetics: Tour of the Basics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.hgp/"&gt;Human Genome Project&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.gen.variation/"&gt;Genetic Variation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make hormone-receptor models in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3313_03_nsn.html" target="blank"&gt;NOVA scienceNOW classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, follow novice runners as they train for a marathon, and discover how quickly the body responds to regular aerobic exercise.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes the effect of exercise on the body and defines one measure used to gauge aerobic fitness. VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max (maximal volume of oxygen uptake) is a measurement of how well the body gets and consumes the oxygen that muscles need in order to sustain activity. Learn how the entire cardiovascular system benefits from exercise and how the body's response to the demands of physical activity is a survival mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Meeting the demands of working muscles involves nearly every system in the body. The cardiovascular system ramps up heartbeat to move blood to the muscles. The respiratory system replenishes that blood with oxygen when lungs fill with air. The digestive system shuts down to preserve energy for where it's most needed. And the skin processes heat from ongoing chemical and metabolic reactions that might otherwise build up to dangerous levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscles contain a limited supply of a chemical called adenosine tri-phosphate, or ATP. When a muscle cell needs energy, it breaks the bond holding ATP's nucleotide and phosphate groups together. This bond releases energy that can be used to fuel chemical reactions that in turn keep muscles moving. However, once the limited supply is exhausted&amp;mdash;typically after a short burst of exercise&amp;mdash;a new supply of ATP must be produced if exercise is to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria, the "powerhouses" of cells, transform food, in the form of stored carbohydrates and fats, into chemical energy, in the form of more ATP. To do this, they require oxygen. The body has several ways of increasing the flow of oxygen to working muscles, including increasing the flow of blood from the heart and increasing the rate and depth of breathing. The body can be trained so that these systems operate more efficiently, beginning at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So-called aerobic endurance training&amp;mdash;"aerobic" meaning "in the presence of oxygen"&amp;mdash;improves the efficiency with which oxygen is delivered to a working muscle, making that muscle perform better. By increasing blood flow through training, hemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells, can deliver more oxygen to the working muscle. Hemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to the muscle and then binds with carbon dioxide waste generated by the muscle. Exercise also causes blood vessels and capillaries to expand, which in turn helps maximize the volume of blood being pumped by the heart. One composite measurement of how well a body utilizes oxygen during exercise is called VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max (maximal volume of oxygen uptake). A high VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max reading means the muscles are producing more and larger mitochondria, which are using all the available oxygen to generate energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max readings, training should be focused on increasing both the duration and intensity of activity. For example, distance runners may gradually increase their weekly mileage program, all the while sustaining their running pace. To safely increase training intensity, which may enhance VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max even more than duration, a runner may engage in what's known as interval training. This means incorporating shorter bursts of higher-intensity running into certain workouts. For example, instead of running an entire workout at 75 to 80 percent of one's maximum heart rate, a runner could perform several 3- to 5-minute intervals at 100 percent of his or her maximum heart rate, allowing recovery time between intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased muscle strength and endurance are two obvious benefits of regular exercise. However, there are several others. Doctors consider obesity a silent killer that affects millions upon millions throughout the world and recommend exercise to help combat the condition. Also, while exercise cannot restore lung function that has been lost, it can improve the lung's ability to take in oxygen, which can benefit patients with respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Lastly, exercise stimulates various brain chemicals, which may produce relaxation and relief from depression or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the connection between physical exercise and the efficiency of cellular respiration, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.cell.mitofx/"&gt;Mitochondria Functions and Training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how mitochondria transform glucose into energy-rich molecules, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.cell.lactic/"&gt;Is Lactic Acid a Four Letter Word?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determine recovery times after exercise in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3414_marathon.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, discover what researchers are learning about sleep by examining the dreams of rats.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; considers the purpose of sleep and, in particular, the connection it shares with memory. By studying the dreams of rats, researchers are hoping to gain insights into how animal brains process new information into memories that can later be tapped. While establishing normal sleep patterns appears to assist the learning process for rats and humans alike, getting too little sleep or having interrupted sleep may explain why some people cannot effectively draw from their past experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a student or a business professional, society puts a high importance on learning and the ability to remember what we've learned so that we might apply it in our lives. Without memory, we would not be able to apply new information. For the rats being studied in this video, good memory can translate into gaining a reward for completing a task. For humans, it can be the difference between passing or failing an exam or being able to perform a job. As this video suggests, sleep may determine our capacity to recall what we learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning and memory have three main components: acquisition, the introduction of new information into the brain; consolidation, the processes by which a memory becomes stable; and recall, the ability to access the information after it has been stored. Each of these steps is necessary for proper memory function. While acquisition and recall occur while we're awake, research suggests that consolidation occurs during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human brains have evolved in such a way that different parts are responsible for controlling these different functions. The hippocampus is considered the control center responsible for processing memories. The memories themselves are stored away in different areas of the cerebral cortex, the large outermost part of the brain. To help determine sleep's role in connecting learning and memory, scientists monitor brain wave activity in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex as we cycle through various stages of sleep during the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each stage, distinct high-voltage or low-voltage activity patterns are recorded on the monitors. Sleep researchers attempt to interpret what effects these stages have on memory. They have found that sleep helps improve some kinds of memory tasks more than others, including recognition of visual patterns, solving puzzles, and learned skills such as typing. Moreover, different stages appear to help consolidate different kinds of memories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep seems to play a role in the consolidation of procedural, or "how-to," memory. This is the stage of sleep in which dreaming occurs most frequently. In the non-REM sleep stages, the bursts of high-frequency neuronal activity that are characteristic of stage 2 sleep, in which adults spend about half their sleep time, may modify neural connections and enhance memories. Also, the slow-wave sleep that characterizes "deep sleep" (stage 3 sleep) might be connected to spatial memories. When rats in this video ran the maze and then replayed the memories as they slept, the neuron firing patterns recorded in the hippocampus appeared in slow-wave sleep, precisely matching those recorded when the rats ran the maze when awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists believe that the same thing happens when we sleep. However, when we are sleep-deprived, our attention drifts. Our over-worked neurons can no longer function to coordinate information so that memories are properly consolidated. Thus, we lose our ability to access previously learned information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about sleep and its effect on brain function, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.reg.teenbrain/"&gt;The Teenage Brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about brain anatomy and function, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.stru.braingeo/"&gt;Brain Geography&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.massgeneral.org/childhoodepilepsy/" target="_blank"&gt;Growing Up with Epilepsy: Brain Anatomy and Development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the different stages of sleep, check out &lt;a href="http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/science/what/sleep-patterns-rem-nrem" target="_blank"&gt;Natural Patterns of Sleep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practice a procedural skill in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3410_01_nsn.html" target="blank"&gt;NOVA scienceNOW classroom activity&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the effects of sleep on learning and memory. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn about the critical role of flowers in seed plant reproductive biology.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; explains how flowers play a central role in the reproductive cycle of plants. Their striking array of colors, patterns, fragrances, and nectar all require lots of energy to produce. But it is these features that attract insects and other animals, which, in turn, carry genetic material from flower to flower. The video describes various parts of the reproductive system, including the stamens and pistil, which generate seeds and ensure the survival of an enormous variety of plant species.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Over millions of years, plants have evolved a variety of adaptations in both form and function to succeed in their struggle for survival. For the types of plant known as angiosperms, flowers are an integral part of the plant's reproductive scheme. Flowers form on a part of a branch called the receptacle. They consist of several distinct yet tightly arranged components that emerge from a single node.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[If you would like to see a diagram of the reproductive components of a flower, refer to &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/asset/oer08_img_flowerimage/" onclick="td_pop('image','http://www.teachersdomain.org/asset/oer08_img_flowerimage/','480','456');return false;"&gt;Flower Reproductive Parts&lt;/a&gt; GIF Image.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sepals and petals are both sterile parts of a flower. The leaf-like sepals surround the flower, protecting it before it blooms. Petals are colorful and often patterned features that are more likely to catch one's eye. Flowers have both male and female reproductive parts. When these occur in the same structural plan, the flower is described as being "perfect." Flowers that contain only male or female parts are called "imperfect." The male reproductive parts, called the stamens, produce pollen. Each stamen consists of an anther, which contains the pollen, and a filament, the stalk-like structure that supports the anther. The female reproductive parts, or carpels, produce the ovules, or eggs. In most flowers, the carpels are fused together to form a pistil, which consists of a stigma, an ovary, and a style&amp;mdash;a long tube that connects the stigma to the ovary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual reproduction in plants occurs when the pollen from a stamen is transferred to a pistil, where it may fertilize the eggs stored inside the ovary. Plants that grow in isolated colonies, including tomatoes and lettuces, can pollinate themselves. Pollen simply fertilizes the eggs on the same flower. However, plants that inhabit a broader area exhibit strategies that prevent self-pollination. For example, some species produce pollen either before or after the stigma is receptive to it. These plants conduct an alternate reproductive strategy, called cross-pollination, through which pollen is carried to a flower of the same species on a different individual plant, often with an animal assisting in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insects and other animals do not knowingly participate in plant reproduction. Instead, they visit flowers for an entirely different reason, typically food. For example, as a honeybee collects the sweet nectar it seeks from a bright and fragrant flower, it also unwittingly collects tiny pollen grains, which attach to its legs and body. When it lands on its next bloom, it leaves behind some of the pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pollen latches on to the stigma of a receiving flower, a series of chemical reactions ensues. The pollen produces a pollen tube, which wends its way through the style to reach the flower's ovary. The pollen's sperm cells travel through the pollen tube to fertilize the eggs. Fertilized eggs develop into seeds, and the ovary develops into a fruit&amp;mdash;the technical term for a structure that encloses and protects a seed or seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all flowers are colorful or fragrant. In fact, some flowers lack petals entirely. Instead of animals, these flowers typically rely on the wind or water for pollination. While these other methods leave much to chance, the plants benefit from not having to devote so much energy to producing such "showy" enticements. Instead they generate a larger volume of pollen to improve their reproductive success rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the different strategies plants use to ensure pollination, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.stru.floral/"&gt;Floral Arrangements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the critical link between honeybee pollination and the produce humans rely on, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/kqed07.sci.life.oate.producers.betterb/"&gt;The Bounty of Bees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the different ways plants transport their seeds to reproduce, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.stru.seedsaway/"&gt;Seeds Away&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the various stages in the life cycle of a flowering seed plant, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/lsps07.sci.life.stru.seedplant/"&gt;Life Cycle of a Seed Plant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extract DNA from bananas in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3405_flower.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, see how nanotechnology might be used to create a new, cheaper way to produce solar electricity for the home.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn about a new solar technology being developed to make solar electricity more affordable. Nathan Lewis, a chemist at the California Institute of Technology, describes how nanotechnology can be used to capture the energy from sunlight in new ways. Investigate how solar paint technology, using titanium oxide processed into nanotubes, could convert sunlight into electricity using relatively cheap materials and offer a solution to the global energy crisis. Hear about early tests of the new technology and how it needs to be further developed.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Electrons&amp;mdash;the negatively charged particles that surround atomic nuclei&amp;mdash;are the basis of electricity. In some materials, including most metals, electrons are only loosely bound to nuclei; in these electrical conductors, electrons can move freely from atom to atom. The electricity that powers familiar devices such as computers, televisions, radios, and light bulbs is simply the flow of electrons. But where does electricity come from?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The electricity we use is a form of energy derived from other energy sources. Power plants, driven by the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, natural gas, and oil) generate the majority of the world's electricity by taking advantage of the relationship between electricity and magnetism. The combustion of fossil fuels produces the heat to boil water, which drives turbines that use steam to create rotational motion. In this process, thermal energy transforms into mechanical energy, which generates electricity as it causes a magnet to spin within a coil of wire; the spinning magnet causes electrons to move within the nearby conductor, creating a flow of electrons through the wire. Nuclear and geothermal energy are also commonly used to generate electricity in a similar manner, and wind and flowing water can also be used to drive turbines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sun also provides a source of energy from which to produce electricity. Solar cells, or photovoltaic cells, convert sunlight directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect&amp;mdash;when certain materials absorb light, electrons are set free. Most solar cells are composed of several layers, including silicon, metal conductor strips, and an anti-reflective coating. When the silicon absorbs sunlight, the energy knocks electrons loose from the silicon atoms; the electrons then flow out of the cell (along the metal conductor strips) as electrical current. The anti-reflective coating increases the cell's efficiency by reducing the amount of sunlight that is reflected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solar power is one of the most environmentally friendly sources of electricity&amp;mdash;it does not produce any harmful emissions, and the Sun provides an essentially inexhaustible source of energy. However, the materials for traditional solar panels are expensive. As technology has improved, the efficiency of solar cells has gone up and manufacturing costs have come down, but the cost of producing electricity from solar energy remains relatively high compared to conventional sources. New solar technologies, such as the possibility of a "solar paint," may be able to reduce the costs of solar electricity to make it more competitive and accessible. Researchers are using nanotechnology (technology at a very small scale) to develop nanoparticles made from cheap materials that can convert sunlight to electricity in new ways. When sunlight strikes these tiny structures, electrons are knocked loose, similar to the way traditional silicon solar cells work. However, instead of installing expensive solar panels on a roof, the entire roof would be "painted" with this inexpensive technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about electricity, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.acdc/"&gt;AC / DC: What's the Difference?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about sources of energy, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.energysource/"&gt;Energy Sources&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.hooverelec/"&gt;Hoover Dam and Hydroelectric Power&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.fission/"&gt;Nuclear Reaction: Fission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about nanotechnology, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/oer08.sci.engin.systems.elevator/"&gt;A Nanotube Space Elevator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3406_solar.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt; to design, build, and test a solar cooker that will pasteurize water.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe some of the advantages of energy generation by solar technology compared to atomic power plants and power plants that burn fossil fuels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are some of the drawbacks of solar panels currently available for homes and other buildings?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;According to Nathan Lewis, why is it important to explore new technologies to solve the problem of energy production?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is nanotechnology?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how "solar paint" works. Why aren't we using this technology right now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn about the effects of gravity as astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson falls through a virtual hole through Earth's center.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, investigate the hypothetical scenario of a person falling into a hole through the center of Earth. Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson illustrates the thought experiment; first he defines the conditions&amp;mdash;ignore the effects of air resistance, temperature, and Earth's rotation&amp;mdash;and then he travels through the hole. A timer and speedometer show how his speed changes as he falls toward the center of Earth, passes the center, and slows to a stop at the opposite end of the hole. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Gravity is a fundamental force of nature; it is an attractive force between any objects that have mass. The strength of gravity between everyday objects, such as a desk and a chair, is extremely small&amp;mdash;too small to be noticed, in fact. However, because the strength of gravity is proportional to the masses of the objects, it is easy to observe the effects of gravity between an object that is very massive, such as Earth, and another object. For instance, objects fall toward Earth's surface because of the force of gravity between Earth and the object; a simple bathroom scale measures your weight&amp;mdash;the force of gravity between you and Earth. Note that the force of gravity acts on both objects; Earth is attracted to you, just as you are attracted to Earth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the location of an object relative to Earth&amp;mdash;whether it is at Earth's surface, some distance away, or within the planet&amp;mdash;the strength of gravity will vary. At Earth's surface, the acceleration due to gravity is about 9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; that is, with every second that passes, the downward speed of a falling object increases by 9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. However, for an object located high above Earth's surface, the acceleration due to gravity is less than 9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This is because the force of gravity is related to the distance between the objects; it is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. In other words, as two objects move farther away from one another, the force of gravity between them decreases. Therefore, the farther an object is from Earth, the weaker the strength of gravity between them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what is gravity like within Earth? How would gravity affect an object in a hypothetical hole through the center of Earth? At the center of the planet, Earth's mass completely surrounds the object, pulling it outward in every direction. Assuming, for this thought experiment, that Earth is spherically symmetric and of uniform density, the attractive force between the object and each part of Earth would counteract a corresponding attractive force from the opposite direction. Consequently, the net gravitational force on the object would be zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following this logic, the net gravitational force on an object inside a uniform spherical shell is always zero. At a given radius from Earth's center, the portion of Earth outside of that radius can be considered a shell; the net force of gravity on an object at a given radius from Earth's center is due only to the mass of Earth within that radius. As a result, as the object approaches the center of the planet and the radius decreases, the acceleration due to gravity would also decrease. Although the rate of change of velocity decreases, the object would continue to increase in velocity until it passes through the center of Earth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how gravity affects the motion of objects on Earth, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.galileoexp/"&gt;Galileo: His Experiments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/hew06.sci.phys.maf.projmotion/"&gt;Projectile Motion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about gravity in the solar system, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.weightworlds/"&gt;Your Weight on Other Worlds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about microgravity, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.freefall/"&gt;Free-Falling and "Weightlessness"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;How would you account for the change in velocity as the person falls through Earth from one side to the other?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson says that it takes 14 minutes to reach a point halfway to the center of Earth and that it takes 21 minutes to reach the center itself. Why does it take 14 minutes to go the first half of the distance but only 7 minutes to go the second half?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What happens as he passes the center of Earth? Why would he cycle back and forth forever?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is this scenario impossible? Give several reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you think scientists know what would happen to a falling object, if such a hole existed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, take a look inside a solar panel to see how it works, and hear firsthand about the benefits from homeowners who are using this technology.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn about photovoltaics and see how two families are using solar technologies in their homes. First, an animation illustrates the process within solar panels that transforms sunlight into electricity. Then meet Phil Reavis, Jr., who explains his interest in solar energy and the environment, and how his family was able to install solar panels on the roof of their house to produce electricity. In addition, tour the custom-designed home of Bill and Debbie Lord, which uses both solar electricity panels and solar hot water panels, and learn about state incentives and net metering benefits. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The Sun is an essentially unlimited source of free energy&amp;mdash;the amount of solar energy that reaches Earth's surface in just one hour is more than the total amount of energy that the world would use in a year. Furthermore, unlike the consumption of fossil fuels, the consumption of solar energy does not produce harmful emissions. The ability to capture and convert solar radiation into usable energy is a great opportunity to make use of an environmentally friendly and abundant source of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the solar technology industry is currently experiencing rapid growth as interest in renewable energy increases, humans have actually been harnessing solar energy since ancient times. For example, some of the earliest ways to make use of solar energy were to use glass to focus sunlight to light a fire, and to build homes and bathhouses facing in the sunniest direction. Today, there are three main types of solar energy technologies: concentrating solar power (CSP), photovoltaics (PV), and solar heating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CSP uses reflective surfaces to concentrate solar radiation onto receivers that then convert it to heat. Solar energy collected this way is used to produce electricity with conventional steam turbine generators. Because CSP plants rely on direct-beam sunlight, they can only be located in areas that receive plentiful sunshine. In the United States, most of the CSP plants are located in the Southwest, although there are plants in development in other areas. CSP technologies are generally used on a large scale, although smaller systems are also possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most small-scale applications, such as residential buildings, PV and solar heating systems are used. PV systems convert sunlight directly into electricity using special cells made of semiconductor materials that produce an electrical charge when struck by solar radiation. This type of technology is especially useful for rural areas that do not have access to the electrical grid; there are many programs that offer financing for PV installation in rural or poor areas of developing countries (such as Bangladesh, China, India, Kenya, and Mexico). Grid-connected PV systems are also growing in popularity: as of 2009, there were over a million homes with solar panels feeding energy into utility grids. Germany accounts for a large part of the global market, although various incentives, such as subsidies, tax credits, and net metering (the policy that allows the excess power generated by a home to be sold back to the grid), are helping to make this technology more widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solar heating gathers solar radiation and transforms it to heat air or a fluid. A common type of solar collector, a flat-plate collector, consists of a flat box with a transparent cover and a dark absorber plate. Heat builds up inside the box, warming the air or fluid (typically water or an antifreeze solution) that flows through it. Solar heat collectors, such as hot water heaters, are common in several countries; nearly 50 millions homes worldwide use solar hot water, and there is a growing trend to install these systems. Some countries, such as Israel and Spain, even have mandates that require minimum levels of solar hot water for new buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about ways to utilize solar energy, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/psu06-e21.sci.pasun/"&gt;Pennsylvania Energy: Energy from the Sun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/wnet08.sci.phys.energy.wnetsolar/"&gt;Solar House&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about solar power, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/oer08.sci.phys.energy.solarpaint/"&gt;Solar Paint Your Roof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/psu06-e21.sci.paphotovoltaics/"&gt;Photovoltaics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about energy consumption, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.eco.energyuse/"&gt;Snapshot of US Energy Use&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about energy sources, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.energysource/"&gt;Energy Sources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn about a chain of events, including ancient volcanoes, global warming, and deadly gases, which may have caused Earth's greatest mass extinction 250 million years ago.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt; examines a developing theory that might explain a 250-million-year-old "murder mystery." While several possible causes have been considered for the mass extinction that occurred at the end of the Permian period, the scientists featured in the video think a chain of events, beginning with massive volcanic eruptions, might have made Earth uninhabitable for a significant number of terrestrial and marine organisms. According to their theory, these eruptions released gases that warmed both the atmosphere and the oceans. This warming in turn created ideal conditions for killer bacteria to poison the environment.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Extinction, which can have a variety of causes, results in the permanent elimination of one or more species. According to most scientists, 99.9 percent of all species that have ever lived are now extinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All organisms have to contend with the pressures of predation, competition, and environmental change. Throughout geological history, we see a "background" pattern of extinction of some species. The background extinction rate removes a family of organisms about every million years. By contrast, mass extinctions appear as abrupt discontinuities in the fossil record, affect many species at once, and have a much greater impact on biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most scientists agree that five extinction events stand out from the rest. Each time, at least 50 to 90 percent of all species living on Earth disappeared. Different causes that have been proposed to explain these mass extinction events include meteor impact, volcanic activity, sea-level change, oxygen depletion, global cooling, changes in ocean chemistry, and glaciation. Scientists generally agree that the reason for any mass extinction can be traced to a variety of environmental factors that may have resulted from a triggering event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extinction that occurred at the end of the Permian period, 250 million years ago, was probably the most severe in Earth's history. For even one family of organisms to be wiped out at once is extraordinary. Yet the death toll at the end of the Permian included 400 marine families&amp;mdash;more than half of all marine families living at the time. It is estimated that this total included 90 to 96 percent of all marine species. On land, three-quarters of all reptiles and two-thirds of the amphibians disappeared from the fossil record. Most plant life, as well as one-third of the orders of insects, also disappeared, marking the only time insects have ever suffered mass extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video presents an emerging theory to explain the cause of the end-Permian extinction. It suggests that there was simply too much heat and too little oxygen in the environment as a result of prolonged volcanic eruptions. Studies of the chemical composition of rocks formed at this time indicate warm, oxygen-poor oceans. Such an environment would favor population explosions of lethal bacteria, whose metabolism generated toxic sulfur gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As compelling as this explanation is, it's not the only one. In fact, a hypothesis first presented in 2001 suggested that the impact of an asteroid as large as seven miles across could have been the triggering event, releasing at least a million times more energy than the strongest recorded earthquake. However, as with any hypothesis, this one will remain unfounded until a large body of physical evidence is collected that supports it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although mass extinctions are deadly events, they open up the planet for new life forms to emerge. For example, during the Triassic period that followed the Permian, dinosaurs became the dominant land animals. And following their extinction 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, dinosaurs made room for mammals to rapidly diversify and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the end-Permian and other extinctions throughout Earth's history, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.deeptime/"&gt;Deep Time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.permtriassext/"&gt;Permian-Triassic Extinction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the role CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plays in Earth's temperature, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.greenhouse2/"&gt;Global Warming: The Physics of the Greenhouse Effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about volcanoes and the threats they pose to the environment, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.volcanerupt/"&gt;Volcanic Eruptions and Hazards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about evidence of regular, extreme climate change throughout Earth's distant past, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.climatechange/"&gt;Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.greenland/"&gt;Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2: A Record of Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.naturalchange/"&gt;Natural Climate Change in Djibouti, Africa&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The video suggests that the scientists are "detectives in a mystery." How are scientists like detectives in this case?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What important gas escapes when volcanoes erupt that might be linked to the end-Permian extinction? What happens to this gas after it is released into the atmosphere?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how a change in ocean chemistry may explain the end-Permian mass extinction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What kind of evidence do scientists cite to support this extinction theory?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you think of ways in which our understanding of this extinction may provide us with an understanding of some of the consequences of global warming?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Learn about the surprising finding of preserved soft tissue in dinosaur fossils&amp;mdash;including possible blood vessels and red blood cells&amp;mdash;in this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn how scientists are hoping to better understand the biology of dinosaurs by studying the insides of fossil bones. Hear about the accidental discovery of dinosaur soft tissue by paleontologist Dr. Mary Schweitzer, and how this tissue enables scientists to learn more about dinosaur physiology and pathology. For example, soft tissue could provide information about toxins that led to dinosaur deaths. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The remains of organisms that have been preserved as fossils offer a glimpse into geological time, but the fossilization process does not typically preserve soft tissues (such as muscles and skin), which contain important biological information. As a result, scientists have only a limited view of the organisms and conditions of the past. However, in 2005, a group of researchers led by paleontologist Dr. Mary Schweitzer announced a surprising discovery that opened up a new window into the past&amp;mdash;soft tissue preserved within a 68 million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex fossil! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an organism to become part of the fossil record, the time between its death and its burial in sediment needs to be rapid; if not, scavengers, bacteria, and weathering processes will destroy it completely. Once buried, according to the conventional theory of fossil formation, groundwater percolates through the remains and minerals fill the empty spaces in the hard parts of the organism (such as bones and teeth), fossilizing them, while the soft tissues decay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists usually take great care to preserve the integrity of their fossil finds; however, Dr. Schweitzer saw something interesting within some fragments of a T. rex bone she had been given and decided to employ an unusual method to investigate. To get a closer look at the bone structure, she placed a fragment in a weak acid solution to partially destroy it. When her team removed the fragment from the solution, they were surprised at what they saw. It appeared that the mineral removal process had left behind intact, pliable soft tissue that seemed to contain blood vessels and cells. This was a seemingly impossible discovery. With skepticism and scientific curiosity, they repeated the process with other fragments and duplicated their findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they published their results, the scientific community was fittingly shocked. It was generally accepted that there was no way soft tissue could survive millions of years. It had long been believed that fossils were completely made of minerals&amp;mdash;that if left to soak in an acid solution that dissolved minerals, the entire fossil would dissolve. The discovery of soft tissue meant that the theory of fossilization would need to be reconsidered, and it opened up a new area of research that hadn't previously been thought possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the initial discovery, Dr. Schweitzer has continued to pioneer this emerging area of research that combines paleontology and molecular biology. Collaborating with colleagues with different areas of expertise (for example, a specialist in techniques to analyze protein sequences), she has found further evidence to support the initial findings. Scientific tests identified the existence of collagen protein, which was then sequenced and compared against the protein sequences of other animals. The scientists observed similarities between the structure of dinosaur collagen and the sequences found in chickens, frogs, and newts. However, controversy still exists over whether soft tissue has been found in fossils at all. In 2008, another team of scientists reported evidence that the flexible material found inside fossils was actually biofilm&amp;mdash;basically, slime created by bacteria&amp;mdash;that was formed in modern times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about fossils, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.fossilintro/"&gt;How a Dinosaur Became a Fossil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.fossilcollage/"&gt;Fossils&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about dinosaurs, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.dinobones/"&gt;Fossilized Dinosaur Bones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.div.dinokill/"&gt;What Killed the Dinosaurs?&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about scientific discovery, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/drey07.sci.phys.matter.scprocess/"&gt;Scientific Processes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the geological timeline, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.evo.deeptime/"&gt;Deep Time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did Dr. Mary Schweitzer originally set out to look for dinosaur soft tissue? If not, how did she arrive at her discovery?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is medullary tissue? Why does it make sense that dinosaur bones share some features with bird bones?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think scientists haven't found soft tissue in fossils before?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think this finding is important? Why is it controversial?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you think of how you might try to resolve this controversy? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Find out how serious head concussions can be in this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn about concussions&amp;mdash;a common type of traumatic brain injury. Hear from Reed Snyderman, a young athlete who describes his personal experience with concussion. In addition, meet Dr. Jam Ghajar, a neurosurgeon and international expert in brain injuries, who explains why concussions are difficult to diagnose and demonstrates a new tool that can help assess brain injury. The portable tool measures disruptions in attention by tracking eye movements and offers a way to quickly and objectively diagnose concussions, even at a sporting event. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encased by the hard bone of the skull and surrounded by a cushioning fluid, the human brain is protected from everyday jostles and bumps. However, a severe impact to or sudden acceleration of the head can cause injury and disrupt normal brain function. The most common type of traumatic brain injury is a concussion, a temporary alteration in brain function resulting from head trauma. Concussions can range greatly in severity and are commonly a result of sports, motor vehicle accidents, and falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not known for sure what happens inside the brain when a concussion occurs: imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) typically do not detect structural damage from a concussion. It may be that during concussion, the bundles of nerve fibers that make up the white matter of the brain are damaged, and these cannot be seen by standard imaging techniques. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the injury appears to disrupt the brain&amp;rsquo;s physiology more than its anatomy, diagnosing a concussion can be difficult. Diagnosis relies on the assessment of the signs and symptoms of concussion (such as loss of consciousness, confusion, amnesia, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating)&amp;mdash;which can be subtle. Neuropsychological tests help evaluate concussion by testing various aspects of cognitive function such as reaction time, attention span, and working memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assessment and management of concussions are important because of the potential consequences of repeated head injuries. There is evidence that damage from multiple concussions is cumulative and can result in permanent impairment, increased likelihood of additional concussions, longer recovery times, and earlier onset of Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease. Although most concussions usually resolve within a short time, symptoms may persist for weeks, months, or years after the initial injury: this is known as post-concussion syndrome and may increase the risk of another concussion. Furthermore, a second concussion before complete recovery from the first can be fatal; second-impact syndrome is a rare condition in which the brain loses the ability to regulate its blood supply, causing it to swell dangerously. For athletic coaches who are often faced with the decision whether to let a player return to play after a potential injury, it is better to err on the side of caution rather than risk further injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thorough neuropsychological evaluation is best performed in a quiet room without distractions, which is not always an option, so a number of new tools are being developed to detect concussion. For example, researchers have created a device consisting of a small computer and display system that also block external stimuli, which provides a portable and convenient way to assess injury. Another, goggle-like device featured in the video examines variations in the brain&amp;rsquo;s timing by measuring how consistently the eye tracks a dot traveling in a circular motion: the greater the variation, the greater the damage. These new devices can provide quick and accurate assessment of concussion, helping prevent potentially dangerous outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the brain, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.stru.braingeo/"&gt;Brain Geography&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about ways to test brain function, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.reg.everestweb/"&gt;Everest: Test Your Brain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how engineering can help prevent injuries, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/eng06.sci.engin.systems.airbag/"&gt;Air Bag Design&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about research on the brain, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/hew06.sci.life.reg.mirrorneurons/"&gt;Mirror Neurons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.reg.teenbrain/"&gt;The Teenage Brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the number one cause of death and disability in young people?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is a concussion? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why does suffering from one concussion increase the chances of having another concussion?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We learn here that it is difficult to diagnose a concussion from the sidelines. How would you advise a coach if one of his or her players received a blow to the head? What do you think about a coach saying to a player who has hit his or her head, "Shake it off and get back on the field"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how eye movements can be used as evidence of what is happening in the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, follow scientists as they test a new theory suggesting that lightning here on Earth is triggered by cosmic rays from far-away dying stars.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA scienceNOW&lt;/em&gt;, learn about how lightning is formed, and see scientists in action as they explore lightning under controlled conditions. A new theory of lightning formation, called "runaway breakdown," hypothesizes that cosmic rays trigger the process. See how researchers set up instruments to observe X-ray evidence to support this theory, and find out about another study that has gathered even stronger evidence.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Lightning is a common phenomenon&amp;mdash;millions of lightning flashes occur every day. Scientists understand the general conditions that are necessary within a storm cloud to produce lightning, but the explanation is incomplete, and the details of lightning formation remain a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a long-held basic theory, lightning is produced by the separation of positively and negatively charged particles within a cloud, which creates an electric field. Scientists are not certain how the charges separate, although it is believed that both the process of freezing and the collision of ice and water particles play a role. It is likely that the strong updrafts and downdrafts within a storm cloud cause water droplets, hail, and graupel (a form of frozen precipitation) to collide with such force that some electrons&amp;mdash;the negatively charged components of an atom&amp;mdash;are knocked free. This leaves some particles positively charged and gives other particles excess negative charge. The heavier particles with excess negative charge gather at the bottom of the cloud and the positively charged particles gather at the top. The cloud becomes polarized as positive charge builds up on one side and negative charge builds up on the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, air is not electrically conductive; it does not allow the flow of electric charges. However, a strong electric field can cause air to "break down"&amp;mdash;the electric field frees electrons from air molecules, ionizing the air so that it becomes conductive. The electrical breakdown of air forms a conductive path for electrostatic discharge, the flow of electrons between areas at different electrical potential. As the difference in charge between the top and bottom of the cloud grows, a strong electric field forms in the cloud, which could lead to an electrical discharge in the form of lightning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, research has found that the observed electric fields of storm clouds are too weak to produce lightning. One new theory for lightning formation suggests that high-energy particles from outer space may trigger a chain reaction that makes the air conductive. Cosmic rays are subatomic particles that travel close to the speed of light and originate outside of Earth's atmosphere. They can come from a variety of sources, including processes in the Sun, supernova remnants, black holes, or quasars. In a process called "runaway breakdown," cosmic rays entering the atmosphere trigger the production of many high-energy electrons by first colliding with particles to produce a few high-energy electrons. Within the strong electric field of a storm cloud, these electrons further accelerate and collide with other atoms, generating even more high-energy electrons, as well as X-rays and gamma rays, which then collide with other atoms. This process creates an avalanche of high-energy particles, resulting in a breakdown region and a conductive path for lightning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about lightning, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.lightning/"&gt;Lightning!&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.mfw.lighthunter/"&gt;Lightning Hunters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about high-energy radiation, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.emspectrum/"&gt;The Electromagnetic Spectrum: FRONTLINE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.nasaspectrum/"&gt;The Electromagnetic Spectrum: NASA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the origin of cosmic rays, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.nova1/"&gt;Birth of a Supernova, Type Ia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.nova2/"&gt;Birth of a Supernova, Type II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This animated essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site examines the design of Galileo's refracting telescope and Sir Isaac Newton's reflecting telescope.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This animated essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site details the design and workings of Galileo's refracting telescope and Newton's reflecting telescope. Newton recognized several shortcomings of the refracting telescope's design and used mirrors in place of lenses to overcome them.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Early telescopes, like Galileo's, were designed on the principles of refraction, or redirecting light by bending its rays as it passes from one medium, like air, into and out of another medium, like glass. A convex objective lens, located at one end of the telescope's tubular body, gathered as much light as possible from a distant object. The larger the lens, the more light it could gather. As light rays passed through the objective lens, its curvature directed the rays to converge and form an image of the viewed object near the other end of the tube, at a place called the focal plane. A concave eyepiece then magnified the tiny image for the viewer to see. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The lenses in Galileo's telescope had a greenish hue from iron contained in the glass and were filled with tiny bubbles that distorted the image. In addition, as explained in more detail below, a colored halo surrounded the images seen in the small field of view. Yet another shortcoming of Galileo's telescope was that magnification could only be improved by increasing the focal length, which meant focusing the light farther behind the objective lens. Tubes were made longer and lenses larger, but there were practical limits to this design: a glass lens large enough to capture the sparse rays from more distant stellar objects would sag under its own weight. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Isaac Newton introduced a new concept in telescope design in which mirrors replaced glass lenses. In a reflecting telescope, a curved concave mirror at the base of the tube gathered light and reflected it to a point of focus situated about halfway back along the tube. There, a second mirror -- flat and angled -- reflected light to an eyepiece located on the side of the tube. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Newton's design held some distinct advantages over Galileo's. For example, lenses naturally cause different wavelengths of light to separate as they pass through them. Light of different colors focuses at different points, causing distortions in the color of the objects under observation, especially around their edges. Mirrors, by contrast, do not separate the colors in this way.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Draw a sketch showing how Galileo's telescope worked. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did the telescope change Galileo's understanding of the Universe? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe a limitation that Galileo experienced when he tried to magnify the heavens more and more. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What limitations of Galileo's telescope was Newton able to address in his new design? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why does the reflecting telescope use mirrors instead of two lenses in a tube as the refracting telescope did? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is meant by the phrase, "standing upon the shoulders of giants"? What is an example from contemporary life? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Will the Leaning Tower of Pisa give way to gravity? In this interview from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, engineer John Burland relates the difficult job of saving the tower.</annotation>
      <synopsis>According to John Burland, the engineer in charge of the most recent effort to stabilize the tower, "The Tower of Pisa is notorious for springing surprises on those who try and stabilize it." However, stabilizing the tower was a risk that government officials and engineers had to take in order to save it. In this interview from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, Burland explains the technique his team used to prevent the Leaning Tower of Pisa from toppling.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Although the Leaning Tower of Pisa's tilt has made it one of the most recognized structures in the world, the tower's designers never intended for it to lean at all. What's more, the tower's tilted stance, which has worsened steadily since shortly after its construction began, has for centuries threatened its stability. In 1990, officials deemed the tower unsafe and closed it to visitors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Long before its closure, engineers recognized that something must be done to prevent the tower's collapse. Over several centuries, dozens of attempts were made to stabilize it. Unfortunately, until recently, none of these interventions had any positive effect on the tower's stability -- and some imposed greater risks on the structure than doing nothing at all. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; By the late 1990s, according to some mathematical models, the tower was leaning so much that it should already have fallen! Something had to be done. In 1999, engineers began removing soil from underneath the tower's north side in an effort to correct its southward lean. Tests and experience with other towers suggested that extracting soil from the high side of the foundation would cause the structure to settle on that side, moving the entire tower back toward a more vertical stance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Indeed, in the first few months, the soil extraction technique caused the tower to move to the north about 2.5 cm (one inch). In the ensuing months, by extracting soil at a higher rate, engineers moved the tower another 42.5 cm (17 inches). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; By June of 2001, engineers declared the stabilization project complete, even though the tower continued to lean about 4 meters (13 feet) past vertical at its top. Presumably, they could have reversed the lean entirely. Instead, they reduced the lean by just 10 percent, an amount sufficient to stabilize the tower for several hundred years without taking away the building's historic charm. The still-leaning Tower of Pisa was reopened to the public in December 2001.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What is causing the Tower of Pisa to lean? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What advance planning and testing was done before engineers tried to straighten out the tower? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think the engineers chose to excavate sand as a way to save the tower? What are some of the advantages of this method? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you think that it is worth the large expense to save the tower? Why or why not? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>The way a firework shell is designed and assembled determines the shape and color of a firework display. Choose a video clip and try to identify each firework variety in this interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>It seems likely that what really wows an audience at a Fourth of July extravaganza is the artistic creativity of the pyrotechnicians shooting elaborate starburts into the nighttime sky. In this interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, test your ability to identify the different shell types that commonly feature in firework displays. First, associate the shapes with their names using the pictures provided. Then, watch each of the six short video clips. Afterwards, compare your guesses by linking to a list of answers.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The primary chemical component in nearly all fireworks is "black powder". The recipe for black powder, a mixture of 75 percent saltpeter (potassium nitrate), 15 percent charcoal, and 10 percent sulfur, originated in China about 1,000 years ago with a slightly different proportion of ingredients. Black powder has been used in loud and fiery displays ever since -- first to ward off evil spirits, and later to entertain and celebrate. Today's fireworks rely on black powder for two critical functions. Gas released when the powder combusts first propels the firework skyward and later blasts its contents outward into the elaborate patterns that spectators come to see. However, other chemical ingredients are also needed; without them fireworks would produce little more than yellowish-orange sparks and white smoke. Due to differences in atomic structure, different atoms give off different wavelengths of light after being heated in a flame. Strontium chloride, for example, burns with a red flame, while barium chloride produces a green flame. To produce multicolored displays, pyrotechnicians, the people who create fireworks, combine several different chemical ingredients into a single firework. The lifting charge, made of black powder, propels the firework skyward. As it travels higher and higher, a time-delay fuse burns. When the firework reaches its peak, the fuse ignites one or more charges that blast the firework's "stars" -- individual pieces made up of these various chemicals -- into the air to form the beautiful patterns that audiences love. In general, the components of a firework expand evenly when the firework explodes. Therefore, the placement of stars inside a firework determines their arrangement when the explosion occurs. For example, a shell loaded with stars made of strontium chloride in the center and barium chloride around the perimeter will produce a flower-like display of red surrounded by green. By varying the type of chemical, as well as the size and configuration of stars, nearly infinite color and pattern combinations are possible.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Name some of the firework shells from the interactive activity. How do you think the design of the firework shell affects the shape it creates? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What kinds of things do you think pyrotechnicians consider when designing an exciting fireworks show? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have you seen other kinds of fireworks shells that were not shown in the interactive? If so, how do you think they were designed? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How important is sound to a fireworks display? Explain. &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Explore this &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; interactive activity to see how engineers have modified a military plane's sound, shape, and heat emissions to minimize detection.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site details what aeronautical engineers must consider when designing an aircraft to avoid both human and electronic detection. It acknowledges that in the engineering design process there are necessary performance tradeoffs to achieving stealth, but in many cases the ability to evade enemy radar detection and missile defense systems is more valuable than speed.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Stealth technology, otherwise called anti-detection technology, incorporates both design and materials engineered to make aircraft, missiles, and even ships difficult to see, hear, or otherwise detect electronically. For an airplane to achieve stealth, however, compromises must be made. These include reduced speed and maneuverability, not to mention higher design and operating costs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For fighter planes in particular, speed is a primary asset. For maximum stealth, however, too much speed is a liability. This is because traveling at supersonic speeds, as most fighters do, creates a tremendous amount of noise, what with the powerful engines expelling air and the sonic boom made when a plane accelerates above the speed of sound. Though some pilots would gladly trade some speed for enhanced stealth, others, whose missions may involve air-to-air combat, would opt for speed at the expense of some quietness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Certain detection and missile systems home in on heat emitted by aircraft to detect their presence. Relocating the engine intake and exhaust equipment to above the wings can lessen the possibility for detection from below. Doing so, however, detracts from overall maneuverability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Radar systems track airplanes by sending out bursts of electromagnetic waves that, on encountering an object, get reflected back to their antennae. Depending on how much of the wave energy is returned and how fast it returns, a radar operator can be alerted to the relative size and location of the object. Several "hits" on the object can also tell the operator in which direction and how fast a moving object is traveling. To make tactical military jets less visible to radar, they must be carefully designed so that any radar waves that are reflected from their surfaces do not return to the transmitter-receiver.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What design features help airplanes avoid detection by radar? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What design features help airplanes avoid contact with heat-sensing missiles? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do stealth planes look so different from passenger planes? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engineering design often involves trade-offs. What trade-offs did designers of the different types of stealth planes choose?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Explore this &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; interactive timeline and discover the many technological innovations in the history of unmanned flight, from hot-air balloons to miniature flying robots.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This interactive timeline from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site charts the evolution of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), from their earliest incarnations as bomb-dropping balloons and camera-equipped surveillance kites, to the development of highly engineered prototypes with stealth capability and palm-sized dimensions. Learn how UAVs play a valuable role not just in military arsenals but also in other areas, such as geographical surveys and environmental studies.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The ability to control an unpiloted aircraft from remote locations offers numerous advantages. With manned aircraft, you must accommodate not only the added weight of a pilot, but also the pilot's safety. In military conflicts, for instance, a plane, if detected, may be shot at by enemy anti-aircraft weaponry. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can fly at higher altitudes over long periods than can piloted craft, and they can perform high-speed evasive maneuvers, the forces of which would stretch a person beyond his or her physical limitations. Freed of the weight of a pilot, UAVs can carry more communications and monitoring equipment. Computerized control systems can also maneuver airplanes more reliably than manual systems can in certain difficult phases of flight, such as low-level night flying over undulating terrain or bad-weather landings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Early UAVs were typically converted airplanes. As mission goals evolved to include high-altitude and long-duration surveillance flights, weapons delivery, stealth capability, weather monitoring, rescue operations, changes in structural designs, fuel systems, and on-board technologies naturally followed. Today's planes are equipped with real-time communications capabilities, advanced imaging systems, television relays, and infrared cameras. Some non-military vehicles have begun to tap solar power and fuel cell storage systems. A class of mini-UAVs, called MAVs, has even been designed to mimic the flying movements of certain insects.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Choose any two consecutive decades and describe the advances in UAV design that occurred during that time. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What design challenge do all of these vehicles have in common? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why are the solutions to that common challenge so different? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you think the United States should devote resources to developing the next generation of pilotless flying machines? Explain your reasoning. &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Think like an engineer and build an aqueduct in this interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In this interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, your goal is to supply a city with water both for residential use and for its public baths and fountains. A builder's manual explains how the Romans engineered aqueducts to maintain water flow from source to destination over diverse terrain. Learn how arcades, pressurized pipes, and trenches functioned in these sophisticated water-delivery systems.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Roman cities wouldn't have thrived the way they did if not for a very sophisticated system of aqueducts that delivered water for residents' personal consumption, as well as for their public baths and fountains. Cities situated on dry plains generally relied on faraway mountain runoff as a source of clean water. But even cities built near rivers often used remote water sources instead of local ones, which commonly became polluted by the waste generated by the cities' dense populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Aqueducts were by and large gravity systems. In other words, they were designed to use the force of gravity to move the water, frequently across tens of miles. The channel through which the water flowed had to slope downward ever so slightly, which meant the engineers -- always keeping in mind the diverse terrain that might lie between source and destination -- had to build whatever solutions were necessary to achieve this feat. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Because some natural springs ran from underground sources, and because pumping water to the surface was not easily accomplished, some aqueducts began as tunnels, dug through the earth and even through rock right to the source. Arcades, many of which still line the landscape over regions that once belonged to the Roman Empire, served as bridges so that water could travel over land and span any dips in it. The arcades' design allowed people and water to pass beneath them. Arcades were constructed when the aqueduct had to flow five feet or more above ground level; any lower than that, and builders would have built a simple wall. Where the aqueduct's intended path ran into mounds of earth, trenches were cut through them to preserve the downward slope. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Once the water reached a city, it was typically directed into a large water-storage tower positioned on high ground. From there, water could be distributed through an underground network of lead, wood, or terra-cotta pipes to various points. The Romans knew that, even though the water would run underground through the pipes, it could be brought up again to a height equal to the water level in the tank.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Can you explain what forces carry the water through the aqueduct? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What different types of construction did the Romans use in their design? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How would you go about constructing the various stages of the aqueduct? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How are different materials used in your final design? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Find out how controlled explosions are used to demolish multi-story buildings in this interview from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Stable structures are able to stand tall because the forces acting upon them are balanced. When a structure must be knocked down, demolition experts use their knowledge of these forces and of each structure's most important elements to do the job effectively. Stacey Loizeaux is one such demolition expert. In this interview from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, she describes some of the knowledge she and her family's demolition team use to bring down large structures quickly and safely.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Because we feel forces most obviously when we're active, it may be surprising to learn that structures such as buildings and bridges withstand tremendous forces simply standing where they are built. A structure's own weight pushes down with nearly unimaginable force, while the ground supporting a structure pushes up simultaneously with equal force. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A structure's parts are constantly being compressed and pulled, but their design and position relative to one another serve to balance the forces on them. The floor of a building, for example, is pulled downward by the force of gravity, while the weight of the floor itself pushes downward on the columns beneath it. The columns push up on the floor in opposition, with a force equal to that of gravity. When these forces are balanced, the structure maintains a state of equilibrium and remains upright. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Understanding the forces at work in a structure is critical for structural engineers, who design structures to withstand myriad forces for decades. Knowing what makes structures stable, however, is also important for the people whose job it is to demolish them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One of the fastest ways to demolish a building is to use explosives. Contrary to what people might think, demolition crews do not use huge quantities of explosives to blow up buildings. In fact, they use as little dynamite as possible and leave the rest of the work to gravity. This is because setting the explosive charges takes time and costs money. Also, the more explosives a demolition crew uses, the more dangerous the explosion will be. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Demolition crews set explosive charges in strategic locations around a structure. In buildings, they concentrate on the columns that support the most weight, especially those between lower floors. By removing or weakening these crucial supports, the crews dramatically unbalance the forces in the building, causing it to collapse, or "implode", under its own weight.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What's the difference between an explosion and an implosion? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do demolition teams use as little explosive as possible? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are some of the challenges associated with taking something large down, in comparison to building it up? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does "load-bearing" mean? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build a model apartment house or office building out of blocks, and then try to demonstrate demolition by implosion. What is the smallest force you need to apply? Where would you apply it?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, traces the evolving history of theories about gravity and a force that may oppose it, along with our understanding of the impact of both of these forces on our expanding universe.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Recent research has found that the universe is not only expanding, but that the rate of expansion is accelerating. To explain this acceleration, scientists have come to believe that there may be a repulsive force caused by "dark energy," an idea first developed by Albert Einstein. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn about the history of our understanding of the expansion of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;In 1998, astonishing observational data revealed that the universe was not only expanding, but that its expansion was actually accelerating. Scientists had long thought that there were three possible shapes for the universe &amp;mdash; closed, flat, and open &amp;mdash; all of which included a slowing of the expansion rate. But recent research suggests that none of these descriptions was entirely right. Observations indicate that the shape of the universe is indeed flat, but that its expansion rate has increased within the past 5 or 6 billion years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are at a loss to explain what could be causing this acceleration, but it is one of the hottest research topics of modern astrophysics. Evidently, there is a mysterious force, dubbed dark energy, which dominates the universe and counteracts the attractive force of gravity on very large scales. Astronomers suggest that 70% of the universe is dark energy and that the normal matter of stars and life composes only about 5%. The remaining 25% of the universe is thought to be dark matter &amp;mdash; matter we cannot see, but that scientists believe exists. The repulsive effects of dark energy could possibly be explained with modified theories of gravity or string theory. However, the struggle to understand dark energy is also resurrecting the history of science. Two promising theories for dark energy are quintessence, a dynamic energy of empty space, and the cosmological constant, a steady energy first introduced by Albert Einstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 1900s, scientists thought that the universe was static &amp;mdash; neither contracting nor expanding. Einstein explored the question of why, with all its combined matter, the universe did not succumb to gravity and collapse in on itself. As an explanation, he introduced the idea of a universal force that opposes gravity and pushes the universe apart. He called this anti-gravity force the cosmological constant. Although he could not measure it, Einstein was convinced that this force had to exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after Einstein proposed the cosmological constant, scientists observed that the universe was much bigger than previously thought. In fact, the astronomer Edwin Hubble concluded it was expanding. Faced with this knowledge, Einstein renounced his own idea, calling it his "biggest blunder." Today, theoretical physicists studying exploding stars, called supernovae, have found that the rate of expansion of the universe is also accelerating. Even though our understanding of dark energy is very speculative, Einstein's idea of the cosmological constant is still a real possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the discovery of the expanding universe, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.fund.hubble2/"&gt;Hubble's Expanding Universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the history and fate of the universe, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.fund.unihist/"&gt;History of the Universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the size of the universe, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.biguniverse/"&gt;How Big Is Our Universe?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What led Einstein to hypothesize the cosmological constant?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What made Einstein wish he could "put the genie back in the bottle"?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the evidence for the Big Bang Theory, as presented in the video?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The narrator indicates that our understanding of the impact of gravity on galaxies and stars may be incomplete. What does he mean?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why were scientists surprised by the evidence that the expansion of the universe was accelerating? What is their explanation in this video for the expansion?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site illustrates the Doppler effect and shows how it applies to measuring the direction and speed of stellar objects.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site provides an explanation of how the Doppler effect, a wave phenomenon, helps scientists studying distant galaxies to gauge their speed and their direction of motion in relation to Earth.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>By observing changes in the color of the light stars emit, scientists can determine the speed of the stars and the direction they move in relation to Earth. The principle that explains the changes in color is closely related to a sound phenomenon we frequently experience here on Earth, the Doppler effect. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Doppler effect is an observed change in pitch (how high or low a sound is) when either the source of the sound or the listener is in motion. Imagine a car, its horn blaring, approaching you as you sit on a park bench. To you, the sound of the horn seems higher in pitch than it would if the car were parked. As the car approaches you, the horn's pitch seems to be high, and if the car keeps the same speed, the pitch stays constant. As the vehicle passes by and moves away from you, the horn's pitch appears to drop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In reality, though, the car horn vibrates at a constant rate, and to the person driving the car, the pitch doesn't change. You, however, hearing the sound from the bench, perceive a change because as the car gains ground on the sound waves traveling out from its horn, it pushes the sound waves together so that the sound wavelengths in front of the car get shorter. As wavelength shortens, frequency increases, so the higher the frequency is, the higher the pitch will be. As the car passes you, the sound waves traveling back toward you are spread out, and have a longer wavelength. This decreases their frequency and lowers the pitch you hear. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Doppler effect applies to all types of waves, including light waves. Astronomers measure the Doppler shift in the frequency of the light stars emit, and from this information they can determine the stars' velocity and direction of motion in relation to Earth. In light, a change in wavelength and frequency is perceived as a change in color. For a star approaching Earth, increasing frequency makes the light appear bluer. This is known as a blueshift. If a star is moving away from Earth, decreasing frequency makes the light appear redder, which is known as a redshift. By measuring the extent of the change in color, an observer can also gauge how fast the star is moving: the faster it moves, the more pronounced the color shift will be. The discovery of redshifts in the spectra of galaxies in the 1920s led Edwin Hubble to conclude that the universe is expanding.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Describe the Doppler effect. What causes it? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is a redshift? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can the degree of redshift in the color spectra of a supernova tell astronomers about the movement and location of stars? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>How fast is 300,000 kilometers per second? This text from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site offers a few real-world comparisons for the speed of light.</annotation>
      <synopsis>The universe has a speed limit: 300,000 kilometers per second. That's 186,000 miles per second, or about 670 million miles per hour! To help convey just how fast light travels, this text resource from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site notes distances and times for short trips and long ones if you could travel at the speed of light.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>To the human eye, light appears to travel at an infinite speed. For two thousand years, from the time of Aristotle, this was the prevailing wisdom on the subject. In the seventeenth century, however, Italian astronomer Galileo became convinced that light, like sound, had a measurable speed. He tried to measure this speed by clocking how long it took for flashing lantern signals to travel back and forth between two hilltops. This method failed, however, largely because light travels so fast and human reaction time over such a short distance is unreliable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Not long after, Danish astronomer Ole Roemer studied the time it took for one of Jupiter's moons, Io, to complete its orbit around that planet. He observed that the amount of time it took Io to reappear from behind Jupiter -- that is, for the Sun's light to reflect off Io's surface and be seen by Roemer -- varied, depending on the distance between Earth and Jupiter. If the speed of light was infinite, he judged, there should have been no such delay. Using the diameter of Earth's orbit and this time lag, Roemer calculated the speed of light as 227,000 kilometers per second, or 140,000 miles per second -- about one-quarter below the modern value of 300,000 km/sec, or 186,000 mi/sec. Imprecise though it was, this was the first physical evidence that light had a finite speed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; So how fast is 300,000 km/sec anyway? Consider the 1.3 seconds that we know it takes for light to travel between Earth and the Moon. It would take nine years to walk this same distance. Even sound would take its time -- 13 days of it -- to make this trip!</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;If it took 9.5 minutes for light to get to Earth, how far away is the star of its origin? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you measure how fast something is going? Can you imagine ways to measure the speed of light? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How long would it take light to go across your classroom? Your school yard? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site asks which items in your home can slow down the speed of light.</annotation>
      <synopsis>You know that light travels at a very high speed. But did you also know that light travels at different speeds in different environments? In this interactive activity from from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, you'll learn that transparent objects, such as glass, cause light to slow down, and that this change in speed actually causes light to bend, a phenomenon known as refraction. Note: This feature originally appeared, in slightly different form, on &lt;em&gt;NOVA's&lt;/em&gt; "Einstein Revealed" Web site as "Joe's Room", which has been subsumed into the "Einstein's Big Idea" Web site.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>When light meets an object, it may pass directly through the object with no effect, be absorbed by the object, or be reflected off the object. When light passes through certain objects, however, it may change direction in the process. The name for this light-bending phenomenon is refraction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Refraction occurs when light leaves one transparent substance, such as air, and enters another one of a different density. The density of a substance affects the speed at which light travels through it. A change in the speed of light causes the light to bend, or refract. Because air, water, glass, and diamonds, for example, possess different densities, light refracts when it passes from one of these substances to another. When light leaves a substance, it resumes the speed it was traveling before it entered the new medium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Light also travels differently through different temperature regions -- even within the same medium. When passing from cold to hot water, light will refract just as surely as light passing from glass into air, because the change in temperature changes the density of the water and therefore the speed of the light passing through it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Refraction can be deceiving, distorting one's line of sight. When light coming from a distant mountain, for instance, changes direction before it gets to your eyes, the mountain may appear to be above the horizon, floating in the sky. Such mirages -- in the desert or elsewhere -- are caused by light passing from hotter into relatively cooler air and refracting in the process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The change in direction of light as it passes from one material to another is the foundation of all optical devices. By understanding refraction, scientists have developed lenses that reduce, magnify, focus, and disperse optical images. Eyeglasses, microscopes, and cameras all depend on bending light as it passes from air into glass and back into air.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Why do you think light slows down in water? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think light slows down most of all in the glass?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look around your classroom. What other things do you think will slow light down?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Do light waves travel through the ether like waves on a lake travel through water? In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, a young Albert Einstein grapples with this question while examining the speed of light.</annotation>
      <synopsis>At the turn of the 20th century, most scientists believed that light traveled through an invisible form of matter they called ether. Einstein disagreed. He asserted that light waves, unlike other waves, could exist where no matter was present. As this video, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; shows, the repeated failure of scientists to prove ether's existence helped confirm Einstein's unconventional thinking.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>By the late 1800s, scientists had already established that light travels in wave form at a speed of 186,000 miles -- or 300,000 kilometers -- per second. Most scientists also believed that light waves had to move through some sort of substance that filled space, just as ocean waves move through water and sound waves move through air. They called this invisible and weightless substance "luminiferous ether, " though no instrument could detect its existence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In 1887, two American scientists named Michelson and Morley set out to prove that this ether did, in fact, exist. They supposed that as the Earth orbited the Sun, it moved through the ether. And just as a person riding a bike generated a breeze, so too did Earth speeding through the ether generate an "ether wind. " Using a half-silvered mirror, the surface of which reflects half the light that strikes it and lets the other half pass through, Michelson and Morley split a beam of light into two parts, angling the mirror in such a way that one part traveled in the direction of Earth's motion in orbit -- or against the ether wind -- and the other part perpendicular to this. Then they measured the time it took each part to reflect off a distant mirror and return. They predicted that the beam directed into the ether wind would move more slowly -- like a boat moving against a current would. However, the two parts of the beam returned at precisely the same time. Because their results never varied with repeated testing, they were forced to conclude that there was no ether wind. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Albert Einstein used the Michelson-Morley results in his special theory of relativity, published in 1905. Einstein argued that light travels at a speed of 186,000 miles per second in all directions at all times and for all observers -- even if one observer is moving relative to another observer. That the speed of light does not vary defied the fundamental laws of physics passed down from Galileo and Newton. This and other assertions in the special theory of relativity completely changed the way scientists thought of time and space.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What is one characteristic property of light? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do we still believe that light must travel through some medium? Why or why not? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe any experiences you have had that related to the speed of something depending on the wind. Does wind affect air travel? Check timetables for airplanes and compare the times for flying from east to west and from west to east.&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>The invention of the telescope helped change our understanding of the universe. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; looks at Galileo's contribution to this technology.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Contrary to what many people think, Galileo did not invent the telescope. In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, the Italian physicist and mathematician improves on an existing spyglass design to create a more powerful one -- a refracting telescope that he then used to study the night sky.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>As early as the 1300s, eyeglasses made from convex, or outward-curving, lenses had been developed and were used by people with trouble focusing on nearby objects. By 1450, eyeglasses with concave, or inward-curving, lenses had been developed for people with trouble seeing objects at a distance. Thus, the primary ingredients for making a telescope -- namely, convex and concave lenses -- had been invented. But it wasn't until 1608 that the Dutch optometrist Hans Lippershey applied for a patent on an invention that combined a convex and a concave lens to get a magnifying effect so that faraway objects could be seen as if nearby. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Italian physicist and mathematician Galileo Galilei learned of Lippershey's "spyglass" device. Despite never having seen it, Galileo worked out the mathematics of the device. He taught himself how to grind lenses, and in a very short time, his mechanical enhancements enabled him to see objects through his telescope at greater distances than Lippershey's spyglass allowed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Early telescopes such as Galileo's were designed to use the principles of refraction, or the bending of light rays as they pass from one medium, such as air, into and out of another medium, such as glass. The convex objective lens, located at one end of the telescope's tubular body, gathered the light from a distant object. The larger the lens, the more light it could gather. As light rays passed through the objective lens, its curvature caused the rays to converge and form an image of the viewed object near the other end of the tube, at the focal point. A concave eyepiece then magnified the tiny image for the viewer to see. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Galileo's first telescope offered limited magnification and a narrow field of view. He eventually succeeded in magnifying an object about 30 times, but realized that enlarging it any further was not practical because the field of view became too small. Galileo used his instruments to make important discoveries concerning the surface of the Moon, the moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, and sunspots.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;How did Galileo make improvements to the telescope?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eyeglass lenses were in use long before Galileo put together his telescope. Why didn?t someone "invent" a telescope earlier?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use the example of Galileo's telescope to illustrate how science advances technology and technology advances science.&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, a team of archaeologists and engineers explores different uses of the lever by recreating the engineering feats of the ancient Easter Island peoples.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, a team of archaeologists and engineers tests one theory of how the ancient peoples of Easter Island (Rapa Nui) might have transported a massive statue, called a moai, from cliff-top quarry to coastal perch and then raised it to an upright position. Levers are simple machines that can help amplify lifting force. As the scientists and local participants discover, even with the mechanical advantage of a lever, the challenge is decidedly difficult and extremely time-consuming.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Archaeological evidence suggests that ancient peoples were able to move enormous objects, some in excess of several tons, without the mechanical advantage provided by modern inventions such as the crane. Think of the colossal carved statues, or moai, on Easter Island; the massive obelisks in Egypt; and the stone monoliths at Stonehenge. Without mechanical equipment, how were these feats achieved? With simple machines, namely levers, which are designed to make work easier for humans by moving or manipulating objects using less physical effort. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The most common lever systems have four components: a lever arm, or length of relatively stiff material; a fulcrum on which a lever balances or pivots; the load, which is the weight or resistance that needs to be moved; and effort, or the force applied to the lever. In a class one lever (there are three classes of levers in all), the fulcrum is positioned between the load and the point where the effort is applied. One end of the lever arm goes under the object to be moved. When downward force is applied to the other end of the arm, the arm pivots on the fulcrum. This pivoting action raises the end of the arm under the object to lift it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A lever's mechanical advantage -- that is, the degree to which it amplifies force -- is determined by the ratio of its lever arms. The more you increase the distance over which you exert force, the more you can decrease that force and still get the job done. The closer the fulcrum or pivot point is to the weight, the less force you have to use and the easier it is to lift the weight. If a lever arm is positioned across a fulcrum so that the side from which you'll exert force is 10 times longer than the load side, you can use it to lift a 1,000-pound object by applying a force of only 100 pounds. To do so, however, you'll have to push your lever arm 10 times farther than the load moves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compare the weights of Egyptian obelisks and Rapa Nui moai to other objects in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/27ei_sle2east.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Using a sketch, explain how the force applied by a lever is affected by its distance from the fulcrum. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In what ways is using a screwdriver to remove the lid of a paint can similar to using a lever to turn the moai on its sled? Can you think of other everyday examples in which levers or lever actions are used to make jobs easier? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why should the task get easier once the moai passes the 45-degree angle? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why was friction important as the moai was raised? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before modern machines, humans built and moved many large things using simple mechanical principles. Do you think that those works (Easter Island, the Great Pyramids, Stonehenge) are more significant than the current large-scale projects that people build (skyscrapers, sporting venues)? Explain why or why not.&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Investigate the mechanical advantage of the lever in this interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site challenges users to lift one end of an obelisk to a height of three feet using only a lever, a fulcrum, weights, and some supporting stones. Levers are one of the oldest simple machines designed by humans. They enable very heavy objects to be lifted with considerably less human force by increasing the distance over which the force is exerted.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Archaeological evidence suggests that ancient peoples were able to move enormous objects, some in excess of several tons, without the mechanical advantage provided by modern inventions such as the crane. Think of the colossal carved statues, or moai, on Easter Island; the massive obelisks in Egypt; and the stone monoliths at Stonehenge. Without mechanical equipment, how were these feats achieved? With simple machines, namely levers, which are designed to make work easier for humans by moving or manipulating objects using less physical effort. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The most common lever systems have four components: a lever arm, or length of relatively stiff material; a fulcrum on which a lever balances or pivots; the load, which is the weight or resistance that needs to be moved; and effort, or the force applied to the lever. In a class one lever (there are three classes of levers in all), the fulcrum is positioned between the load and the point where the effort is applied. One end of the lever arm goes under the object to be moved. When downward force is applied to the other end of the arm, the arm pivots on the fulcrum. This pivoting action raises the end of the arm under the object to lift it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A lever's mechanical advantage -- that is, the degree to which it amplifies force -- is determined by the ratio of its lever arms. The more you increase the distance over which you exert force, the more you can decrease that force and still get the job done. The closer the fulcrum or pivot point is to the weight, the less force you have to use and the easier it is to lift the weight. If a lever arm is positioned across a fulcrum so that the side from which you'll exert force is 10 times longer than the load side, you can use it to lift a 1,000-pound object by applying a force of only 100 pounds. To do so, however, you'll have to push your lever arm 10 times farther than the load moves.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Using the "Lever an Obelisk" interactive activity, explain how the force applied by a lever is affected by its distance from the fulcrum. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where should you position the fulcrum if your goal is to apply the least amount of force to raise the obelisk? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In what ways is using a screwdriver to remove the lid of a paint can similar to lifting an obelisk? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have you used any levers today? Describe how they work.&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; features synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which uses radio waves to create high-quality images. Examine SAR images of Washington, D.C., and learn about this technology's unique advantages.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site explains how synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology uses radio waves to create high-quality images that allow operators to identify objects on the ground from high overhead, even in complete darkness or low-visibility conditions caused by bad weather. It also provides users an opportunity to analyze an actual SAR image made of Washington, D.C.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Digitized images taken from surveillance aircraft, like the image that appears in this activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, are not like traditional optical photographs. They are instead computer-generated interpretations of information contained in radio waves. Radar devices work by measuring the time it takes a radio wave to travel from a transmitter to an object and back to a receiver. Distance to the object is calculated based on the time interval measured. This is useful for detecting an object's position and assessing the direction and speed it's moving (if it is, in fact, moving). To create a detailed, three-dimensional image, more data is needed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) devices are capable of capturing that additional data. From its on-board location, a SAR device sends pulses of high-frequency radio waves toward the ground. The pulses return to the device, but do so with varying amounts of energy depending on the characteristics of the objects off which they're bounced. SAR devices have short transmitting antennae. Operating over a long distance, however, they can effectively simulate a much longer, more powerful antenna. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The energy contained in a returned radar beam does not provide much useful information. It is only through powerful software and processing that we can combine multiple readings taken over time and distance to deduce what's down there. The more information processed, the higher the resolution of the image. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A digitized image is made up of pixels, which are very small squares that appear as dots on a computer monitor or ink on a printout. The resolution of a digital image is measured by counting the number of pixels across and down. With SAR processing, as with other powerful imaging systems, about a thousand calculations are performed for each pixel, producing an image containing several million pixels, like that of Washington, D.C., which appears in this activity.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Describe what synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology is and how it is used to create an image. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communication devices require transmitters, encoders, decoders, receivers, and storage devices as part of their system. What are the components used in the SAR image? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is using radar in creating images an advantage over using the visible light spectrum?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site explores sources of radiation, both harmful and beneficial, natural and manmade.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Radiation, like energy, comes in many different forms and from many different sources. This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site identifies common forms of radiation that people encounter throughout their lives and explains where they come from and what effects they might have on human health.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The term radiation strikes fear in the hearts of most people. Yet, all of us are constantly exposed to radiation, and for the most part, we suffer few adverse effects. In fact, some forms of radiation are critical to life. Without light and heat from the Sun, both forms of electromagnetic radiation, Earth would be a dark, cold, and lifeless place. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Radiation may be in the form of electromagnetic waves such as light and gamma rays, or energetic particles such as neutrons, protons, and electrons. Regardless of its form, all radiation carries energy and affects matter by transferring its energy to the particles in matter. This causes the atoms and molecules of the affected material to vibrate or to undergo a change in their chemical arrangement or internal state or structure. Sometimes the impact of the radiation is beneficial. Light striking plant leaves, for example, causes chemical changes that make it possible for plants to store energy that they and other organisms can use for food. The addition of energy from radiation sometimes increases molecular movement slightly, and causes warming or a change in state, from solid to liquid or liquid to gas. An example of this type of change is the melting of snow in the sunlight. In other cases, radiation's energy is powerful enough to knock the electrons out of atoms or molecules, transforming them into negatively or positively charged ions. Radiation at such a high energy level is called ionizing radiation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Scientists call substances that spontaneously give off radiation in the form of waves or particles and undergo changes at the nuclear level, &lt;em&gt;radioactive&lt;/em&gt;. When atomic nuclei have certain numbers of protons and neutrons, they are stable. With more or fewer neutrons, the nuclei spontaneously, although not necessarily quickly, change their state into another arrangement with lower energy by emitting particles and radiation. The emitted particles are normally neutrons or electrons and sometimes alpha particles--two neutrons and two protons bound together. The radiation may be high-energy gamma radiation, a form of electromagnetic radiation with a much shorter wavelength than visible light.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Which forms of radiation are not harmful to life? Which are? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are some of the naturally occurring radioactive sources contained in the earth? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are potential sources of radiation inside a house? Inside you? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What radiation sources can you identify in your classroom? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What radioactive elements can you name and where would you expect to find each of them?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>What happens when you approach the speed of light? This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; follows one of Albert Einstein's thought experiments and his quest to find the answer.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Einstein's special theory of relativity states that the same laws of physics hold true in all inertial reference frames and that the speed of light is the same for all observers, even those moving with respect to one another. In this video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, one of Einstein's thought experiments is re-created to reinforce one consequence of special relativity: that events that are simultaneous to one observer are not to an observer in a different reference frame that is moving with respect to the observer in the first reference frame.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Einstein's special theory of relativity is one of the greatest intellectual achievements in mathematical physics ever made. While difficult to grasp, with a basic knowledge of algebra and some careful thought, it is possible to attain a certain level of understanding of the subject and why it has had such a profound impact on our view of the physical world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The first tenet of relativity is that the rules governing the way things move and interact are the same for two observers moving at constant velocity with respect to one another. An object can be in motion for one observer and at rest for another. But physical laws -- for instance, the ones that govern how things are put into motion -- must be the same. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; At the time Einstein began work on relativity, mathematical theory, backed by experimental results, had already established that the speed of light was not dependent on the speed of its source. As a light-giving object -- say, a bicycle headlight -- moves toward you, the energy that collects on its surface lifts off the surface in the form of tiny interactive electric and magnetic fields. (This light can be conceived of as photons or as a localized bundle of electrical and magnetic fields carrying energy.) Once light breaks free from the material thing that gave birth to it, it flies off at a speed completely determined by its own internal electromagnetic processes -- that is, at a speed that does not depend at all on how (or whether) its source is moving. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Now, this property of light is a bit peculiar, especially considering our experience with normal, everyday projectiles. When an object is launched from a moving platform, it picks up the speed of its platform. Imagine pitching a baseball from a mound that is moving toward home plate at 50 miles per hour. That's one way to speed up your fastball! But if you were pitching light instead of a baseball, the moving mound wouldn't change the speed of your pitch. That is because the speed of light is constant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Einstein took this peculiar phenomenon to the absolute limit of seriousness. He realized that time and space must be quite different from the way we normally think of them if the speeds of projectiles and their launch pads do not always add up the way we assumed they did. So Einstein conceived a new theory of time and space that showed, among many other things, that if speeds don't add up when one of the objects is moving at the speed of light, then they don't actually add up so simply even for slower-moving objects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The steps Einstein took to develop his special theory of relativity are as follows: First, Einstein tried to understand what must be implied by the fact that light travels at a speed independent of its source. From this, he realized that time and space are not simply two unrelated concepts; rather, they must be linked in a space-time system whose properties appear most dramatically when objects move very fast and are observed by two different observers moving with respect to one another. His final and greatest step led him to discover and clarify mathematically many new things about the world that are important in each and every frame of reference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In each and every frame of reference, there are relationships that hold because of the nature of space and time. If space and time were to be reconceived in a new interactive way, then other things, like momentum and energy, had to be reconceived, too. In fact, momentum and energy are linked like space and time. The famous equation E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; first emerged due to the newly understood properties of space and time. As you give a projectile more motional energy, its inertia, or resistance to acceleration, also increases. In other words, mass increases with energy. This equation also relates to all chemical and nuclear reactions that release radiation or thermal energy. It establishes that in a reaction that produces energy, the mass of the products will be less than the mass of the reactants, and the difference is related to the amount of energy produced. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Use this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3213_einstein_01.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt; to create a timeline of scientists involved with E = mc2.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Both jugglers see the clubs moving at the same speed. Why is this possible if one of them is moving and the other is standing still? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why can't the two observers agree on when the lightning bolts hit the poles? (Consider the relationship between distance, time, and speed.) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider the implication that to an observer, the car would shrink to 44 percent of its length. How does this relate to both jugglers seeing the clubs moving at the same time? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Explore &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Online's interactive steam engine and discover how this machine can convert heat to mechanical energy.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In an age of high-powered sports cars and low-emission hybrids, steam engines seem terribly quaint. But not so long ago, a steam-powered warship was the most advanced military craft in use. This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site illustrates and describes the inner workings of the USS &lt;em&gt;Monitor's&lt;/em&gt; piston steam engine.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Gasoline-powered engines haven't always been the standard. The first vehicles not to depend on animal power depended instead on steam. Reliable if a bit cumbersome, steam engines were used throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and even into the twentieth, to power locomotives, factories, and ships -- including the RMS &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt; and the famed warship the USS &lt;em&gt;Monitor&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Not all steam engines were alike. The &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt; and many later steam-powered ships used so-called turbine engines. The USS &lt;em&gt;Monitor&lt;/em&gt;, the Union Army's secret battleship during the early stages of the Civil War, used a much more common type of engine, called a reciprocating, or piston, steam engine. This was the same type of engine used by steam trains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The principle of the piston steam engine is simple: Water is heated by a coal or wood fire, producing steam. The steam builds up and becomes pressurized inside the engine. Valves at various locations control the movement of the steam through the system. An open valve allows steam to pass; a closed valve keeps the steam from escaping. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Double-acting steam engines, like the one illustrated in this activity, are particularly efficient because they allow steam to act alternately on both faces of the piston. The double-acting steam engine relies on a special type of valve called a slide valve. The slide valve allows high-pressure steam to enter one side of the cylinder, where it then pushes the piston to the opposite side. At the same time, the valve allows the steam that filled the opposite side of the cylinder during the previous stroke to escape through an exhaust pipe. Because the piston's action operates the slide valve, the movement of these two components remains perfectly synchronized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As the piston moves back and forth in the cylinder, it pushes or pulls a drive rod, which attaches to a flywheel. The drive rod is attached to a point that is off center on the flywheel. As a result, the drive rod's straight side-to-side or up-and-down action causes the flywheel to turn.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Starting with the coal, explain how energy is transformed in a steam engine. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you think of an example of an object that works because of steam? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What technologies replaced the steam engine as an energy source for transportation? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think that steam-powered vehicles are not commonly used today?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this media-rich essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, astronomer Brent Tully of the University of Hawaiʻi walks you through the latest scientific theories about the size of the universe.</annotation>
      <synopsis>How big is the universe? Long considered one of the most perplexing questions, it's on the minds of many astronomers these days. Some even think they can answer it. In this media-rich essay from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Online, Brent Tully, astronomer and co-producer of the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; film "Runaway Universe, " discusses astronomy's latest theories on the size -- and shape -- of the universe.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Determining the size of the universe is a huge undertaking. Despite centuries of speculation and scientific exploration, the question of how big our universe really is -- or if it is, in fact, infinite -- remains unanswered, and may be unanswerable. Sheer scale presents the greatest challenge to determining the size of the universe, which is simply too large to see in its entirety. Even the most advanced instruments, which allow astronomers to observe galaxies 10 to 12 billion light years away, give no clue to what lies beyond the distance light could have traveled since the birth of the universe, about 14 billion years ago. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; These challenges have not stopped astronomers from trying, though. After all, scientific understanding often follows from indirect observations, the formulation of theories and testable hypotheses, and the creation of scientific models. For example, at the opposite end of the scale with regard to size, no one has ever seen an atom. Yet, through experimentation and indirect observations, physicists have developed a clear understanding of this once mysterious particle's basic structure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The same scientific process, based mostly on indirect observations, has led to some startling discoveries about the size of the universe. In 1929, for example, astronomer Edwin Hubble found that the universe is expanding, rather than collapsing, as the theory of gravity would suggest. More recently, astronomers have found evidence to suggest that the expansion of the universe, rather than slowing, is accelerating in response to an unknown force stronger than gravity. This latest theory is based, in part, on the wavelength of light given off by exploding stars, called supernovae. This indirect evidence allows astronomers to determine both the distance and the rate of acceleration of the supernovae and the galaxies to which they belong. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Ultimately, such diligent use of the scientific process may result in an answer to the question, How big is the universe? Then again, we may never know. Regardless, the search for an answer will undoubtedly provide a better understanding of many other aspects of our universe and may give rise to a whole new set of compelling questions.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Why are we surrounded by a "horizon" we cannot look beyond? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the implications of the theorized process of "inflation"? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the evidence for cosmic acceleration? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; follows two teams as they each test a different engineering design in an effort to explain how ancient Egyptians raised a giant stone obelisk.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, two teams test out two theories put forth by archaeologists to explain how ancient Egyptians might have raised massive obelisks to stable, upright positions. While only one plan works in practice, both attempts demonstrate that difficult challenges require careful planning.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Archaeological evidence suggests that ancient peoples were able to move enormous objects, some in excess of several tons, without the mechanical advantage provided by modern inventions such as the crane. Think of the colossal carved statues, or moai, on Easter Island; the massive obelisks in Egypt; and the stone monoliths at Stonehenge. Without mechanical equipment, how were these feats achieved? With simple machines, namely levers, which are designed to make work easier for humans by moving or manipulating objects using less physical effort. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, two different teams using two different approaches tackle the challenge of erecting an obelisk in a given amount of time using only materials and techniques available to the ancient Egyptians. From the start, both teams knew that the height and weight of the granite object was such that it could not be lifted or pushed up into place relying solely on the physical strength of workers. So they used levers. Among the most basic and time-tested of all machines to make use of mechanical advantage, levers were used to prop up the obelisk to a position from which it could then be set upright. But levers were only part of the ancient Egyptians' -- and the teams' -- designs; gravity, friction, and tension were also expected to do some of the work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Though only one approach proved successful, both teams had worked through the engineering design process in hopes of improving their chances of raising up the obelisk. They identified the challenge, researched which materials they thought the Egyptians might have used to address it, and made drawings and plans. One team even tested its ideas using a scale model. Both teams followed the engineering design process so that when it came time to implement their designs, they could feel confident that they'd arrived at the plan they thought would work best. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Discover how levers work by raising a brick with shish kebab skewers in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/27po_sle2phar.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What is the role of the deep groove on the side of the obelisk's pedestal? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What did the first team think was its mistake? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you think using a model was helpful to the first team of engineers? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why did the second team use sand? What force of nature played a role? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you think a model could have been helpful to the engineers using the second method? How? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Was the theory behind either of the ways to raise an obelisk incorrect? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive game from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site explores what happens to time as a traveler approaches the speed of light.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity suggests, among other things, that time slows down for an object traveling near the speed of light in relation to a stationary observer. In this interactive game from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, send a person on a speeding rocket to far-off stars and learn how velocity and distance traveled influence how the person ages compared with someone on Earth.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>In his Special Theory of Relativity, Einstein stated that Newton's idea that space, mass, and time were absolute and unchanging was wrong when put to extreme tests. Because the speed of light is constant under any circumstance -- that is, for moving and stationary observers alike -- Einstein reasoned that space, mass, and time become variable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; That time in the moving reference frame passes more slowly than time in the stationary reference frame is a concept known as time dilation. This means that a clock in motion with respect to a stationary observer is perceived by the observer to run more slowly than a stationary clock. The closer the moving clock's velocity to the speed of light, the more its seconds appear to get stretched out. It's not the mechanics of the clock that get stretched out; it's that time itself gets dilated. Applying this to a biological clock, then, a person traveling on a rocket ship at great speed -- like the twin who travels through space in the "Time Traveler" activity on this Web site -- would age more slowly relative to an observer on Earth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Though it seems far-fetched, time dilation is a real phenomenon, proven by experiment. In 1971, scientists tested Einstein's theory on time dilation using atomic clocks, which are capable of measuring time to the billionth of a second. One clock was set to record time on the ground, while another traveled around the world at 600 miles per hour on board a jet. Though both clocks showed the same time at the start of the experiment, the jet's on-board clock was behind by a few billionths of a second at the completion. Just as Einstein would have predicted, time had passed more slowly for the clock traveling at a fast speed. Projecting these results over a much greater speed -- like c, the speed of light -- the time difference would be much more exaggerated.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Why does time slow down as you approach the speed of light? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What two factors would affect the rate at which a person in a rocket ship ages? How would they affect it?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, string theorist Brian Greene introduces the basic ideas behind string theory and how it might help us better understand the universe.</annotation>
      <synopsis>What might a "theory of everything" look like? Wouldn't it have to be impossibly complex -- as complex as the physical world itself? As string theorist Brian Greene explains in this essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, when physicists talk about string theory as a unifying theory, they mean that at the most microscopic level, everything is similar -- everything consists of vibrating strings. Such a theory, Greene argues, would not be an end of scientific exploration, but a solid foundation for further exploration.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>String theory is a revolutionary way of describing the world. It states that all aspects of our universe -- all the particles that make up matter, and all the forces that act on those particles -- are made up of tiny strings of energy. According to string theorists, these imperceptibly tiny strings, or loops, of energy hold the key to understanding and explaining the behavior of the smallest particles and the largest bodies in the universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; String theory is not so different from many earlier scientific theories. The objective of string theory and earlier theories of physics is what physicists call unification. The goal of unification is to describe unimaginably complex phenomena in the simplest possible terms, and to mathematically connect seemingly disparate physical concepts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Isaac Newton did exactly this when he developed his theory of gravity, which says that any two objects -- from the smallest to the largest -- exert an attractive force on each other. According to Newton's theory, the strength of this force depends on the mass of the objects and the distance between them. For over two hundred years, Newton's theory of gravity made it possible to unify our understanding of falling objects at the surface of Earth with the attraction between the Sun and planets in our solar system, as well as with many other diverse phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the twentieth century, Einstein set out to unify two concepts: his new and revised theory of gravity and electromagnetism. He wanted to prove mathematically that these two forces -- the only ones known at the time -- are governed by one underlying principle. However, shortly after he began this quest, the tide of theoretical physics swung toward quantum mechanics, and Einstein died without seeing the fulfillment of his dream of a unified field theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; String theory basically takes up where Einstein left off -- but with an even bigger objective: it attempts to attribute the properties of all fundamental particles and forces to the vibrations of strands of energy, called strings. String theory may one day prove to be the "theory of everything" that its proponents suggest, but even if it doesn't, at the very least, according to string theorist Brian Greene, if it is correct, this theory will provide the most solid foundation yet for truly understanding the universe.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What is string theory? How might it help us better understand the universe? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the relationship of strings to atoms and the particles within atoms? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the four forces of nature? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does string theory describe fundamental particles and forces? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How might finding a "theory of everything" impact other sciences, such as psychology, biology and geology? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt; NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, traces the evolving history of theories about gravity and a force that may oppose it, and the impact of both on our expanding universe.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Albert Einstein once proposed that there was a force that opposed gravity and kept the universe from collapsing in on itself. But several years later, as a result of new information, Einstein dismissed his own idea as foolishness. This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt; NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, explains why modern researchers investigating our expanding universe think Einstein may have been right after all.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Theoretical physicists use mathematics to describe and make predictions about the physical world. Since technological limitations make them unable to observe the behavior of the universe through experimentation, they must operate in the abstract. Working at the frontier of scientific understanding means grappling with the unknown -- and possibly the unknowable. Proposing theories is thus particularly risky for a theoretical physicist, as proof for bold new ideas may be years in coming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the early 1900s, scientists thought that the universe was static -- neither contracting nor expanding. Albert Einstein explored the problem of why, with all its combined matter, the universe did not succumb to gravity and collapse in on itself. As an explanation, he introduced the idea of a universal force that opposed gravity. He called this anti-gravity force the cosmological constant. Although he could not measure it, Einstein was convinced that this force had to exist. How else could anyone explain the fact that the universe was static? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Scientific understanding is always subject to change. Not long after Einstein proposed the cosmological constant, scientists observed that the universe was much bigger than previously thought; the astronomer Edwin Hubble concluded it was, in fact, expanding. Faced with this knowledge, Einstein renounced his own idea, calling it his "biggest blunder." Though Hubble's new findings were widely accepted, scientists now faced new questions: If the universe was so big and continuously expanding, what was driving expansion? And shouldn't the force of gravity at least be slowing it down? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Today, theoretical physicists studying exploding stars, called supernovae, are learning more about the rate of expansion of the universe and how it has changed over time. Instead of finding that the expansion rate is slowing, they've learned that it's accelerating. To explain this, some of the scientists have proposed the existence of something called dark energy, a form of energy that is pushing space outward. Dark energy, while still very speculative, might relate to Einstein's earlier idea of the cosmological constant.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What led Einstein to hypothesize the cosmological constant? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What made Einstein wish he could "put the genie back in the bottle?" &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is meant by the "Big Bang" theory? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why were scientists surprised by the evidence that the expansion of the universe was accelerating? What is their explanation in this video for the expansion? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; introduces the basic ideas behind string theory and looks at the quest for unification.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Had Einstein lived another 10 years, might his quest for a unified field theory have resulted in an idea akin to modern string theory? Brian Greene, string theorist and host of &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;: "The Elegant Universe," thinks this is quite possible. In this video segment, Greene outlines the quest for what physicists call unification.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>String theory is a revolutionary way of describing the world. It states that all aspects of our universe -- all the particles that make up matter, and all the forces that act on those particles -- are made up of tiny strings of energy. According to string theorists, these imperceptibly tiny strings, or loops, of energy hold the key to understanding and explaining the behavior of the smallest particles and the largest bodies in the universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; String theory is not so different from many earlier scientific theories. The objective of string theory and earlier theories of physics is what physicists call unification. The goal of unification is to describe unimaginably complex phenomena in the simplest possible terms, and to mathematically connect seemingly disparate physical concepts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Isaac Newton did exactly this when he developed his theory of gravity, which says that any two objects -- from the smallest to the largest -- exert an attractive force on each other. According to Newton's theory, the strength of this force depends on the mass of the objects and the distance between them. For over two hundred years, Newton's theory of gravity made it possible to unify our understanding of falling objects at the surface of Earth with the attraction between the Sun and planets in our solar system, as well as with many other diverse phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the twentieth century, Einstein set out to unify two concepts: his new and revised theory of gravity and electromagnetism. He wanted to prove mathematically that these two forces -- the only ones known at the time -- are governed by one underlying principle. However, shortly after he began this quest, the tide of theoretical physics swung toward quantum mechanics, and Einstein died without seeing the fulfillment of his dream of a unified field theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; String theory basically takes up where Einstein left off -- but with an even bigger objective: it attempts to attribute the properties of all fundamental particles and forces to the vibrations of strands of energy, called strings. String theory may one day prove to be the "theory of everything" that its proponents suggest, but even if it doesn't, at the very least, according to string theorist Brian Greene, if it is correct, this theory will provide the most solid foundation yet for truly understanding the universe.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Why do you think the analogy of music is used to help explain basic string theory? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think string theory is called the "Holy Grail" of modern physics? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What was Einstein's dream? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How might finding a "theory of everything" impact other sciences, such as psychology, biology, and geology? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site explores the impact Einstein made on physics and most everything we know about the cosmos.</annotation>
      <synopsis>He established that the speed of light is constant, but that time and space are not as simple as had been thought. He found that energy and mass were intimately related, and that gravity resulted from the effect of energy and matter on space and time. He even conceptualized black holes -- invisible stellar objects -- long before they were proven to exist. In this essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, learn why Albert Einstein tops many people's lists of the greatest-ever scientific geniuses.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The author of this essay argues that between 1905 and 1925, Albert Einstein "transformed humankind's understanding of nature on every scale, from the smallest to that of the cosmos as a whole." Who could argue with this? Historians have taken to calling 1905 alone, the first year in this span of remarkable productivity, the "annus mirabilis". That's Latin for the miracle year. This was when Einstein published his Special Theory of Relativity, demonstrating that space and time are not absolute as Isaac Newton had said centuries before. Though employed full-time as a patent clerk, Einstein also proposed the idea that light exists not as waves, but as tiny energy packets called photons, and that these photons are capable of traveling in either particle or wave form. Within the same theory that linked space and time, he established that energy and matter are linked, which led to perhaps the most famous equation of all: E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What does it mean to see light as both waves and particles? What theory does each property help to construct? (Why doesn't one work for both?) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain why Einstein thought he needed a "cosmological constant" to keep the universe static, and why he later jettisoned it. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is contemporary string theory an heir to Einstein's unified field theory?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes the general theory of relativity and the theory of electromagnetism.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, string theorist Brian Greene recounts how Einstein's conception of "space-time" in his general theory of relativity helped explain how Newton's understanding of gravity was incomplete. With this new picture of gravity, Einstein sought to build an even grander theory that included the forces of electricity and magnetism, or electromagnetism.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>In the late nineteenth century, Scottish mathematician James Clerk Maxwell devised a set of four fundamental equations that describe the behavior of both electric and magnetic fields. These equations provided the basis for unifying electricity and magnetism into a single force called electromagnetism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Einstein used Maxwell's equations to develop his special theory of relativity (1905), which shows how light -- an electromagnetic wave phenomenon -- behaves in different frames of reference. He later used the equations to develop his general theory of relativity (1915), which explains gravity and the geometry of the universe. In both theories, time is not completely separate from what is happening in space. Indeed, observers in different frames of reference (that is, moving with respect to one another) find that their measurements of the rate at which time passes do not agree. In his general theory of relativity, Einstein also established that time and space are bound together in a four-dimensional space-time continuum. Einstein used "space-time" to explain why Newton's understanding of gravity was incomplete. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Einstein concluded in his general theory of relativity that an object's motion due to gravity could be understood not as a response to a force, but as free and unforced movement in a region of space and time that had been distorted by the presence of a mass. We feel gravity on Earth because Earth's mass causes a curvature of space-time. Our bodies respond to that curvature by accelerating toward Earth's center. What's more, the larger the mass, the greater the curvature. The obvious curved path we see a tossed object take at Earth's surface is not the curvature of space-time Einstein is talking about. His curvature is in a four-dimensional space, with time as the fourth dimension, and is more subtle than that. Still, that more-subtle curvature does explain the path in three-dimensional space we see before us.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;How does Einstein's explanation of gravity differ from Newton's understanding of gravity? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the "ripples of gravity" in space-time travel at the same speed as light, what does this tell us about gravity? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do compasses behave in the presence of strong electrical fields? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What did Maxwell's four mathematical equations describe?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This illustrated essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site introduces the basic concepts of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and what we know about cosmology as a result.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which develops from the idea that gravity is equivalent to acceleration, was the first major new theory of gravity since Isaac Newton's. In this media-rich text resource from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, read why someone might call general relativity "the biggest leap of the scientific imagination in history."</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>In this resource, MIT professor and author (&lt;em&gt;Einstein's Dreams, Good Benito&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Dance for Two&lt;/em&gt;) Alan Lightman explains the implications of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. General Relativity predicts, among other things, the bending of starlight by gravity, a slight irregularity in Mercury's orbit, and the existence of black holes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Because no one else was thinking of gravity in the same terms as he was -- that is, as a geometrical phenomenon and a bending of time and space -- and because experimental results have yet to prove him wrong, Lightman states that Einstein merits the acclaim he has received as a scientist uniquely creative in his time.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What and how did Einstein theorize about the relationship between gravity and acceleration? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why does the exhaustion of a star's nuclear fuel cause it to collapse? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Astronomer Carl Sagan discusses the possibility of time travel in this audio-enhanced interview from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In this audio-enhanced interview from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;Web site, astronomer, author, and science popularizer Carl Sagan offers wide-ranging thoughts on time travel. He explains what paradox means in the context of time travel and why time travel is consistent with natural laws. He also offers reasons why we haven't met any time travelers and describes theoretical natural phenomena like wormholes that may one day be the means for time travel.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>In investigating the consequences of James Clerk Maxwell's equations of electromagnetics, Albert Einstein developed a theory that shows how light waves are observed to behave in different frames of reference. One of the consequences of Maxwell's equations -- and a foundation of special relativity -- is that the speed of a light wave is constant: 300,000 km/sec, no matter what reference frame it is observed in. Einstein built on Maxwell's equations and established that time is not unchangeable, as nearly everyone preceding him had thought. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Einstein later developed a General Theory of Relativity that explains gravity and the geometry of the universe. In both of his relativity theories, he established that time and space are bound together in a four-dimensional "space-time" continuum. Space-time consists of the three coordinates of space -- up-down, left-right, and backward-forward -- plus one of time, and events can only be analyzed and understood in a system in which space and time are linked in fascinating ways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; These theories show that time travel to the future is, in a certain sense, possible. Time passes at different rates in two separate reference frames that are moving with respect to one another. In principle, it is possible for two people to travel in separate directions and return to the same place with more time having passed for one of them than for the other. Whether or not this constitutes travel into the future, however, is a matter of interpretation. In addition, atomic clocks have been used to prove that the warping effect of gravity changes the way time is measured, which is a tenet of general relativity. In order to get significant effects from either of these relativistic effects, however, very fast speeds or strong gravitational fields are required. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; But since Einstein's conclusions -- and, indeed, even long before then -- people have considered how one might travel through time, and the implications of such travel. Contrary to popular conceptions, most theories of time travel do not rely on time machines. Instead, proponents suggest that time travel will likely be done by way of entirely speculative natural phenomena -- things like rotating black holes, wormholes, and cosmic strings -- that will transport us instantly forward or backward from one point in time to another.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Do you think time travel is possible? Why or why not? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is the speed of light connected to time travel? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is a wormhole? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; discusses the challenge of proving the scientific validity of string theory, in question because strings may be too small to ever be seen or detected, and therefore tested.</annotation>
      <synopsis>As attractive as their idea of unification may be, string theorists are now facing the difficult task of proving their theory's scientific validity. In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, physicists discuss what would have to be achieved for string theory to be accepted as scientifically viable.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>String theory is a revolutionary way of describing the universe. It says that all aspects of our universe -- the particles that make up matter and the forces that act on those particles -- consist of tiny strings of energy. According to string theorists, these imperceptibly small strings, or loops, of energy hold the key to understanding and explaining the behavior of everything from the smallest particles in the universe to its largest bodies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; But many physicists, including some string theorists themselves, recognize that the strings their theory hangs on are the greatest stumbling block to the acceptance of this radical idea. Far smaller than any subatomic particle identified so far, strings may be too minuscule to ever be seen or detected, which leads to the question: How can string theory be tested? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To be scientifically useful and valid, a theory must make predictions that are testable. Confirming a prediction lends support to a theory; negating a prediction suggests the theory may be wrong. Unless such tests can be performed, an idea is simply philosophical, not scientific. Without confirmation that the mathematical theory based on strings explains ideas that were not understood before, string theory may never be fully accepted as a scientifically valid concept.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What is string theory? What does it hope to achieve? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does it mean to ask if string theory is science or philosophy? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;String theory is a kind of theoretical physics. Can you think of some other physics theories that now are accepted as proven science? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How might string theory help us better understand the universe? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; discusses the challenge of unifying the force of gravity and the forces described by quantum mechanics into a single theory of unification.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In the last decades of his life, Albert Einstein was left behind by much of the rest of the physics world. While fully respecting his enormous accomplishments in relativity, gravity, and quantum theory, Einstein's contemporaries did not share his passion for unifying divergent strands of physics. Today, as string theorist Brian Greene explains in this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, most physicists agree that Einstein was probably on to something after all.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Albert Einstein spent the last 30 years of his life working on his unification theory. Meanwhile, much of the rest of the physics world had traded its interest in unifying the forces of nature for a better understanding of the particles that make up matter. The result: the new and ever-developing quantum theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the years leading up to Einstein's death in 1955 and afterward, the gap widened between physicists who relied on general relativity to study large objects and physicists who used quantum mechanics to understand tiny particles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Each group had its own theory that worked for that particular discipline. That was the case until the concept of black holes was introduced during World War I. If black holes exist -- and physicists now generally agree they do -- they present a problem for the two-theory physics world. After all, the very bottom of a black hole is both massive and tiny, which means that to understand a black hole, both general relativity and quantum mechanics must be applied. Yet these two theories are in direct conflict with each other. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; String theorists believe that the key to unifying these two conflicting ideas is in tiny loops or strands of energy called strings. If string theory is right, then all matter and all forces, no matter how big, small, powerful, or weak, are unified, because they all come from different vibrations of the same string.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Which scientific theory describes the world of the large? Which theory describes the world of the small? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is a black hole? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does string theory "come to the rescue" in the quest for a unification theory? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss how resistance to different ideas might impede the scientific process. &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive timeline from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site recaps the theoretical origin and formation of the universe, and forecasts its eventual fate.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This interactive timeline from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site recaps what has happened since the theorized "Big Bang", including the birth of the earliest galaxies and of our own Sun, and it forecasts future events, from the merger of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies to the death of the universe.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The current consensus among scientists is that there was a "Big Bang" at the very beginning of the universe, an initial explosion that generated time, space, and all the matter and energy that exists. In the immediate aftermath of this event, fundamental forces such as gravity emerged, and then fundamental particles. Ever since this time, believed to be at least 15 billion years ago, the universe has been expanding -- more slowly at times, faster at others. Scientific observations suggest that this expansion might ultimately either drive our Milky Way galaxy to merge with a neighboring galaxy, Andromeda, or cause the two to rip each other apart. Although this is bad news for our galaxy, expansion won't stop there. The final timeline entry describes the expected scene trillions of trillions of years in the future, when universal energy will finally have been expended, and the universe will end.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What is meant by the "Big Bang" theory? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are some of the basic forces and elements in the universe? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What factors contributed to the birth of our Sun? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are astronomers' predictions about the future of the universe? What evidence provides the basis for these? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Why do hot air balloons float? This resource from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site offers a series of interactive activities that illustrates the physics of hot air balloons.</annotation>
      <synopsis>It makes sense that a balloon filled with a lightweight gas such as helium would float when surrounded by heavier air. But why does filling a huge balloon with hot air also make it float? This resource from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site offers a series of interactive activities that describes and illustrates the physics (mass, volume, density) of what happens inside hot air balloons.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>No two materials are identical. Some of the differences between them are visible, such as the sparkle of a quartz crystal compared to the dull finish of a lead bar. Other differences can be felt when we pick up two objects or can be determined more specifically by measuring the objects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For example, an iron bar with the same dimensions as a wooden stick will weigh significantly more than the stick; it will have more mass. Although the two objects take up the same amount of space (they have the same volume), because one has more mass than the other, they must be composed differently inside. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The difference between two such objects is their density. The density of a material is determined by dividing an object's mass by its volume. This means that the greater the mass of a given volume of material, the higher the material's density. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For some materials, density remains almost fixed, regardless of environmental conditions. A block of steel, for example, has nearly the same density, whether it is at sea level or at an altitude of 3000 meters, and whether it is cooled to 0 degrees Celsius or warmed to 100 degrees Celsius. Since its volume barely changes when warmed that much, its density also stays almost the same. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In contrast, the density of gases varies dramatically under different environmental conditions. At higher temperatures, gas molecules move more rapidly and bump into each other more frequently. If maintained at same pressure while they are heated, they will expand, and decrease in density. The difference in the density of warm air inside a balloon and cool air outside the balloon causes a hot air balloon to rise and float.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Why do helium balloons rise in air? Why does oil sit on top of water? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do hot air balloons float? What property remains the same? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you think would happen if you added four people to the hot air balloon at the end of the interactive activity? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now, using what you know about hot air balloons and density, describe why boats float.&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This illustrated demonstration from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site explains the concepts of buoyancy and density by showing what happens when different kinds of wood blocks are dropped in water.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This illustrated demonstration from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site uses blocks of wood in water to explain the connection between the amount of water displaced by an object and the object's density. This connection is key to understanding buoyancy, as the density of an object relative to the density of a surrounding fluid determines whether the object floats, sinks, or remains suspended in the medium.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The Greek mathematician Archimedes first noted that any object immersed or partly immersed in a fluid (i.e., a liquid or a gas) is buoyed upward by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. The crucial factor in determining an object's buoyancy is its density, the relationship between its weight, which is pulling it down, and its volume. If an object placed in water weighs more than an equal volume of water -- in other words, if the density of the object is greater than the density of water -- then the downward force of gravity will be greater than the upward buoyant force, and the object will sink. On the other hand, if the object weighs less than the fluid it would displace if submerged, it will sink only to the point where it displaces the amount of fluid equal to its weight. At that point, the upward force of the fluid equals the downward force of gravity, and the object floats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; When a block of wood is placed in water, it sinks until it displaces the amount of water with a weight equal to its own. At this point, the upward force on the block from the surrounding water is equal to the downward force of gravity. Because the wood block is less dense than water -- that is, taking up more space for the same weight -- it remains partially out of the water and floats. A block of steel, by contrast, sinks to the bottom of the water. Steel, made mostly of iron atoms, has a much greater density than water or wood, primarily because iron atoms are much heavier than the hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon atoms of the water and wood. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; So, how can huge ships, which are made mostly of steel, float? By changing the shape of the steel into a hollow drum or bowl, a ship's effective density is altered. The density of a hollow ship is calculated by dividing the gross weight of the ship -- the combined weight of the steel, any cargo on board, and the air contained in the vessel -- by their combined volume. As a hollow object begins to sink down into the surface of the water, it displaces a much larger volume of water than it would if it were solid. Since the hollow ship acts like any other object with a large volume for its weight, provided its overall density is less than that of water, it will float.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What happens to the water level when you place a block of wood in a pail of water? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does the weight of the water that the block of wood displaces compare to the weight of the wood? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What would happen to the water level in the pail if more of the floating block was submerged? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider a block that is no longer floating but is resting on the bottom of the pail. If you kept the volume of the block the same and increased its mass, what would happen to the water level in the pail? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would a block of wood behave the same way in salt water as it does in fresh water? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive brainteaser from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site challenges you to explain the behavior of a helium-filled balloon in a moving car.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Which way do you think a helium balloon inside an idling car will move when the driver puts the pedal to the metal? Put your understanding of the factors that influence an object's buoyancy to the test in this interactive brainteaser from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The Greek mathematician Archimedes first noted that any object immersed or partly immersed in a fluid (i.e., a liquid or a gas) is buoyed upward by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. The crucial factor in determining an object's buoyancy is its density, the relationship between its weight, which is pulling it down, and its volume. If an object placed in water weighs more than an equal volume of water -- in other words, if the density of the object is greater than the density of water -- then the downward force of gravity will be greater than the upward buoyant force, and the object will sink. On the other hand, if the object weighs less than the fluid it would displace if submerged, it will sink only to the point where it displaces the amount of fluid equal to its weight. At that point, the upward force of the fluid equals the downward force of gravity, and the object floats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The helium-filled balloon featured in this brainteaser is less dense than the air it displaces. The air around the balloon pushes up on it with a force greater than that of gravity pulling it down, and it floats in air, just as a piece of wood floats in water. As a result, it rises to the top of the car. When the driver of the car hits the accelerator and the car jerks forward, everything in the car gets pushed forward and accelerates along with the car. The driver is pushed forward by the force of the seat moving forward, and the air in the car is pushed forward by the force of the air just behind it moving forward. The helium balloon is also pushed forward by the force from the surrounding air. However, because the helium balloon has less mass than the air it displaces, which is also pushed forward, the balloon accelerates even more than the car, the person, and the air, and as a result, it moves to the front.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Before you make a selection, which answer do you think is correct? Why? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain why the balloon goes forward when the car does. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Imagine a cork floating in a jar of oil in a moving car. If the car -- and the jar along with it -- accelerates, will the cork move forward or backward in the oil or stay in the same place? Explain. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What if the car -- and the jar along with it -- stops suddenly? Will the cork move forward or backward in the oil or stay in the same place? Explain. &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive brainteaser from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site challenges you to figure out what happens to the water level when a rock is resting in a boat and when it is submerged in water.</annotation>
      <synopsis>You're sitting in a boat in a pool of water. With you in the boat is a large rock. You toss the rock overboard. Will the pool's water level rise, fall, or stay the same? Put your understanding of the factors that influence buoyancy to the test in this interactive brainteaser from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The Greek mathematician Archimedes first noted that any object immersed or partly immersed in a fluid (i.e., a liquid or a gas) is buoyed upward by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. The crucial factor in determining an object's buoyancy is its density, the relationship between its weight, which is pulling it down, and its volume. If an object placed in water weighs more than an equal volume of water -- in other words, if the density of the object is greater than the density of water -- then the downward force of gravity will be greater than the upward buoyant force, and the object will sink. On the other hand, if the object weighs less than the fluid it would displace if submerged, it will sink only to the point where it displaces the amount of fluid equal to its weight. At that point, the upward force of the fluid equals the downward force of gravity, and the object floats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In this featured brainteaser, when the 10-pound rock is in the boat, it is floating, so, in addition to what the boat would displace without the rock, it also displaces the amount of water with a weight equal to the rock. When the stone is hurled in the air -- so that it is out of the boat but not yet in the water -- the boat is relieved of the rock's weight and displaces less water. Consequently, the water level in the pool drops. When the rock enters the water, it displaces a volume of water equal to its size. Because the same volume of water weighs less (perhaps only 3 pounds) than the same volume of rock (10 pounds), the denser rock sinks to the bottom. The water level rises again, but not as high as it was when the rock was in the boat because it is now displacing less water. The net effect of throwing the rock in the pool, then, is a lowering of the water level.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Before you select an answer, do you think the pool's water level will rise, lower, or stay the same when the rock is tossed into the pool? Why? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain why the pool's water level went down when the rock was thrown into the pool. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When an oil tanker is emptied of its oil, what do you think happens to the level of the tanker in the water? What do you think happens to the water level? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive brainteaser from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site challenges you to figure out what causes an object to sink.</annotation>
      <synopsis>What will it take to make a floating toy sub sink to the bottom of a bathtub? Put your understanding of the factors that influence an object's buoyancy to the test in this interactive brainteaser from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The Greek mathematician Archimedes first noted that any object immersed or partly immersed in a fluid (i.e., a liquid or a gas) is buoyed upward by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. The crucial factor in determining an object's buoyancy is its density, the relationship between its weight, which is pulling it down, and its volume. If an object placed in water weighs more than an equal volume of water -- in other words, if the density of the object is greater than the density of water -- then the downward force of gravity will be greater than the upward buoyant force, and the object will sink. On the other hand, if the object weighs less than the fluid it would displace if submerged, it will sink only to the point where it displaces the amount of fluid equal to its weight. At that point, the upward force of the fluid equals the downward force of gravity, and the object floats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A steel toy submarine floats because its hollow interior is filled with air, causing its overall density to be less than that of water. As a result, the buoyant forces pushing up on the toy sub are greater than the weight pulling it down (gravity). Objects that float are positively buoyant. In its present state, the toy sub -- the subject of this brainteaser -- is less dense than water. Thus, the weight of the sub is less than the weight of the water that is displaced when the sub is submerged in the water. If the empty space inside the sub were filled with a pound of sand, the force pulling down on the toy sub would be exactly the same as the force pushing up on it. Since objects in a suspended state have neutral buoyancy and will remain suspended at the same depth until another force acts on them, the toy sub would be suspended in the water, neither sinking to the bottom nor rising to the top. When a bit more than a pound of sand is added to the sub, however, the downward force -- a weight now greater than two pounds -- exceeds the upward force, and the boat sinks. Objects that sink are negatively buoyant.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Before you make a selection, which answer do you think is correct? Why? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain why you needed to add more than one pound of sand to the sub's interior in order for it to sink to the bottom of the tub. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What will happen to the level of water in the tub when the sub sinks? Why? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This illustrated essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site answers questions about irregularities in the tides.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Our scientific understanding of the forces responsible for the tides makes it possible in some coastal locations to predict tidal highs and lows to the nearest minute. Most coasts experience two high tides and two low tides at regular intervals throughout the day. However, as this article from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site explains, the world also has many tidal irregularities.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The physical forces that cause the tides have not always been understood. Long before science attempted to explain them, most people believed either that the gods were responsible or that Earth itself was "breathing" and causing ocean waters to rise and fall in regular intervals. Many early scientists -- the most prominent being Galileo -- tried and failed to find a clear and accurate explanation for tides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We now know that tides are caused by the Moon's gravitational pull on Earth, which causes ocean waters to bulge on the side of Earth closest to the Moon and on the opposite side and gives rise to two high and two low tides per day in most coastal regions around the globe. As this article from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site explains, however, astronomical influences create a variety of tidal curiosities.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Pick one of the Tidal Curiosities and explain it to your classmates, creating your own diagrams to illustrate your explanation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What kind of tide does Earth experience when the Moon, Earth, and the Sun form a right angle, with Earth at the vertex? Why? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this media-rich essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, learn about the atomic structure of radioactive carbon and how it can be used to determine the age of organic remains, such as bones and teeth.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This media-rich essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site explains how scientists can measure the presence of a radioactive form of carbon -- carbon-14 -- in decaying remains to calculate the ages of bones, cloth, wood, and other organic matter. The technique they use, which is effective for dating objects no more than 40,000 to 60,000 years old with a high degree of accuracy, is called radiocarbon dating.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Scientists choose from two primary techniques to determine the age of artifacts and other objects found in the earth. Radiocarbon dating is used for dating once-living matter less than 40,000 to 60,000 years old, like fossilized bones and teeth. Radiometric dating is used for dating objects millions and even billions of years old. Both techniques rely on the properties of radioactive isotopes, which are unstable elements that decay into stable ones over time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the early decades of the twentieth century, scientists first developed an understanding that certain elements are radioactive and that these unstable isotopes decayed -- or lost particles from their nuclei, thus becoming different elements -- at a constant rate over time. Knowing a radioactive isotope's decay rate, a scientist can say that after a given amount of time, half of the atoms in a radioactive "parent" sample will be transformed into its stable "daughter" product. After another equal amount of time, half of the remaining radioactive atoms will decay. And so on. This is what is meant by "half-life." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Living plants exchange their carbon with the carbon in the air. The air contains mostly carbon-12, the most common carbon isotope, but it also contains a small amount of carbon-14, a radioactive isotope produced in the atmosphere when cosmic rays bombard nitrogen atoms. All living plants -- and all living things that depend on plants -- contain these two isotopes in the same ratio as the air does. When a plant or other living thing dies, it stops taking in fresh carbon from the air. While its carbon-12 content remains constant, its carbon-14 content decreases because carbon-14 is radioactive and slowly decays into nitrogen. Hence, the ratio of the two isotopes changes over time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730 years, which means that in 5,730 years, half the carbon-14 atoms will have changed to nitrogen. Assuming carbon-14 has always been present in the atmosphere and in all living things in the same concentration, the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in a sample of a dead plant and the ratio in living plants can be measured and then compared to help determine when the plant died. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Dating beyond the 40,000 to 60,000 year threshold using radioactive carbon is problematic -- even with the most advanced detection instrumentation -- because so little carbon-14 remains in a sample after that time. After 5,730 years, a decaying piece of organic matter will contain half of the carbon-14 it died with. After 11,460 years, it will contain one-fourth, and after 57,300 years, it will contain only one-tenth of one percent.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What is the source of carbon in your body? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do plants and animals have the same proportion of carbon-14 and carbon-12? Explain your reasoning. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is meant by "half-life"? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What technology can be used to determine the ratio between carbon-12 and carbon-14 atoms within a specimen? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Can you think of specific instances where radiocarbon dating has provided valuable evidence? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Our understanding about the air we breathe has changed dramatically through time. This illustrated timeline from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site tracks the changing thought on air and the creation of the Periodic Table of the Elements.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This illustrated timeline from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site details important discoveries made between 1618 and 1785 as scientists Boyle, Lavoisier, and others investigated the physical properties of gases, including air. Lavoisier's work led to the creation of the Periodic Table of the Elements in 1869 by Dmitri Mendeleev.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that air was one of four elements (along with water, earth, and fire) that combined to make everything in the world. And for 2,000 years, air -- a word used to describe any gas, including the very oxygen we breathe -- remained a mysterious and misunderstood state of matter. Even Galileo and Descartes were unaware of its true nature and behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; But beginning in the seventeenth century, the veil that obscured our understanding of air steadily began to lift. Isaac Beekman was the first to realize, in 1618, that air had physical properties. About 50 years later, John Mayow suggested that air was composed of two gases, one of which supported life and combustion, the other of which did not. Finally, three scientists working in the 1770s made the discovery of oxygen, which became known as "pure air": Carl Scheele was the first to synthesize oxygen; Joseph Priestley was the first to report its discovery; and Antoine Lavoisier was the first to truly understand the chemical nature of oxygen. Lavoisier used his newfound knowledge to mount a confident attack on the influential yet misguided phlogiston theory, which attempted to explain why air initially supported combustion but gradually lost its capacity to do so. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Throughout the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Lavoisier, Scheele, Priestley, and others identified many of the chemical elements that, in 1869, would be arranged in order of increasing atomic mass by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in a listing called the Periodic Table of the Elements.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Over the past four centuries, what major theories of "air" have been proposed? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why was the phlogiston theory misguided? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you think of another example of a scientific explanation that was reasonable given the tools and knowledge at the time but was later disproved by new evidence? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you think theories that are later proved incorrect help or hinder the development of scientific ideas? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This illustrated essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site looks at the fundamental forces and particles that make up all matter.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Scientists have striven for centuries to describe the universe in its simplest terms. Today, physicists recognize 19 elementary particles that make up all the matter and forces of the universe. This illustrated essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site describes the physical properties of each of these particles.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>One of the most widely recognized scientific symbols is the atom, which shows negatively charged electrons orbiting a dense nucleus made up of positive protons and neutral neutrons. Although physicists still generally agree on this basic atomic model, they also acknowledge that it is incomplete. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; At one time, physicists thought that protons, neutrons, and electrons were fundamental particles, meaning that they are not made of anything smaller. However, since the 1950s, more and more evidence has been discovered for the existence of even smaller particles. For example, physicists now know that protons and neutrons, the particles that make up an atom's nucleus, are built from six types of particles, collectively called quarks. In addition, they have found evidence for about a dozen other types of elementary particles, some associated with matter and others with the forces that act on matter. Many physicists surmise that all matter and forces are comprised of these 19 different types of particles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Today, many physicists subscribe to what is known as the standard model of particle physics. This model classifies all matter particles as either quarks or leptons. In addition, it places all particles responsible for forces into another group, the bosons. By placing all 19 matter and force particles into these three categories, the model explains the properties and behaviors of all particles in the simplest of terms, an inherent objective of all scientific theories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Whether or not quarks, leptons, and bosons are in fact fundamental is yet to be determined. String theorists think not. According to their calculations, all particles are made up of even smaller vibrating strands of energy, called strings. These strings, if they exist, would only differ from one another in their levels of energy and patterns of vibration, and would therefore be truly fundamental.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Which elementary particle carries electromagnetic radiation? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does the elementary particle graviton carry? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In what way(s) does looking at a table of facts about elementary particles help you to understand the nature of matter? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where would the information about elementary particles fit into the Periodic Table of the Elements? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do the elementary particles relate to the Bohr model of the atom?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>There's more to a fireworks display than meets the eye. This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site looks at the technology behind each burst of light.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Fireworks have changed a great deal in the 1,000 years since they were first developed in China. This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site details some of the most important chemical and structural features that allow fireworks to fly higher and burst more loudly and colorfully than ever before.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The primary chemical component in nearly all fireworks is "black powder." The recipe for black powder, a mixture of 75 percent saltpeter (potassium nitrate), 15 percent charcoal, and 10 percent sulfur, originated in China about 1,000 years ago with a slightly different proportion of ingredients. Black powder has been used in loud and fiery displays ever since -- first to ward off evil spirits, and later to entertain and celebrate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Today's fireworks rely on black powder for two critical functions. Gas released when the powder combusts first propels the firework skyward and later blasts its contents outward into the elaborate patterns that spectators come to see. However, other chemical ingredients are also needed; without them fireworks would produce little more than yellowish-orange sparks and white smoke. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Due to differences in atomic structure, different atoms give off different wavelengths of light after being heated in a flame. Strontium chloride for example, burns with a red flame, while barium chloride produces a green flame. To produce multi-colored displays, pyrotechnicians, the people who create fireworks, combine several different chemical ingredients into a single firework. The lifting charge, made of black powder, propels the firework skyward. As it travels higher and higher, a time-delay fuse burns. When the firework reaches its peak, the fuse ignites one or more charges that blast the firework's "stars" -- individual pieces made up of these various chemicals -- into the air to form the beautiful patterns that audiences love. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In general, the components of a firework expand evenly when the firework explodes. Therefore, the placement of stars inside a firework determines their arrangement when the explosion occurs.

      <annotation>What gives a fireworks display its brilliant blue, green, and red colors? Learn how pyrotechnicians give fireworks color in this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Although black powder remains one of the most important components in fireworks today, in order to create the colorful displays audiences expect, it must be combined with many other chemical compounds. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes some of these compounds and explains how pyrotechnicians use them to create fireworks.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Fireworks have changed tremendously since they were first used nearly 2,000 years ago by the Chinese in spiritual ceremonies to frighten away evil spirits. As forms of entertainment, fireworks have become louder, brighter, more complex, and more colorful. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Black powder is the oldest and most important chemical component of fireworks. This mixture of 15 percent charcoal (carbon), 10 percent sulfur, and 75 percent saltpeter (potassium nitrate) provides the fuel and the explosive force that carries fireworks high into the sky and causes them to burst forth in all their fiery brilliance. However, like many chemical compounds, black powder produces only one color when it is heated. It gives off a bright yellow flame that is nothing like the brilliant reds, oranges, greens, blues, and violets that fill the night sky each Fourth of July in the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To create fireworks of different colors, pyrotechnicians, the people who make fireworks, rely on their knowledge of chemicals. Just as different elements and compounds have specific densities and melting points, combustible elements and compounds also produce light of a specific wavelength, or color. For example, strontium chloride, a metal salt commonly used in fireworks, produces a characteristic red flame, while barium chloride produces a burst of green light. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; These characteristic colors are the result of energy transfer. When a substance is heated or burned, electrons surrounding the nuclei of the atoms that make up the substance are raised temporarily to higher energy levels. When the electrons fall back to their stable states, they release energy in the form of light and/or heat. The level of energy released from each type of atom corresponds to a particular wavelength of light. Low-energy emissions have relatively long wavelengths and give off light nearer the red end of the light spectrum. High-energy, short-wavelength emissions correspond to colors nearer the violet end of the spectrum. Pyrotechnicians use their chemical knowledge to combine different compounds into the elaborate patterns that lure audiences to their displays each year.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What breakthrough did pyrotechnicians make in the early 19th century and how did it affect their craft? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What color of the visible light spectrum is reflected when chemical compounds containing strontium are heated? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the relationship between the electromagnetic spectrum and the combustion of metal salts? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How are white fireworks made? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn how pyrotechnicians use common compounds to blast fireworks into the sky and give them shape.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Without some powerful way to blast them high above the ground, firework displays could only be enjoyed by small groups, rather than the large crowds they entertain today. This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, shows how pyrotechnicians load and fire these magnificent displays.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The primary chemical component in nearly all fireworks is "black powder." The recipe for black powder, a mixture of 75 percent saltpeter (potassium nitrate), 15 percent charcoal (carbon), and 10 percent sulfur, originated in China about 1,000 years ago with a slightly different proportion of ingredients. Black powder has been used in loud and fiery displays ever since -- first to ward off evil spirits, and later to entertain and celebrate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Today's fireworks rely on black powder for two critical functions. Gas released when the powder combusts first propels the firework skyward and later blasts its contents outward into the elaborate patterns that spectators come to see. However, other chemical ingredients are also needed; without them fireworks would produce little more than yellowish-orange sparks and white smoke. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Due to differences in atomic structure, different atoms give off different wavelengths of light after being heated in a flame. Strontium chloride for example, burns with a red flame, while barium chloride produces a green flame. To produce multicolored displays, pyrotechnicians, the people who create fireworks, combine several different chemical ingredients into a single firework. The lifting charge, made of black powder, propels the firework skyward. As it travels higher and higher, a time-delay fuse burns. When the firework reaches its peak, the fuse ignites one or more charges that blast the firework's "stars" -- individual pieces made up of these various chemicals -- into the air to form the beautiful patterns that audiences love. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In general, the components of a firework expand evenly when the firework explodes. Therefore, the placement of stars inside a firework determines their arrangement when the explosion occurs. For example, a shell loaded with stars made of strontium chloride in the center and barium chloride around the perimeter will produce a flower-like display of red surrounded by green. By varying the type of chemical, as well as the size and configuration of stars, nearly infinite color and pattern combinations are possible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Trace the evolution of fireworks from their invention to today in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2903_firework.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Who discovered gunpowder? What is the most important chemical compound in gunpowder? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur become explosive after they are ground together? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe what pyrotechnicians call "stars." &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the design of a star-filled shell that results in a burst of color high in the sky. How are various firework shapes achieved? What designs might pyrotechnicians use? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What series of events take place once a firework shell is ignited? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do pyrotechnicians control the timing so that the firework doesn't explode until it is 500 feet in the sky? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this interactive periodic table from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, find out the role of various elements in making fireworks.</annotation>
      <synopsis>The list of chemicals used in fireworks has grown dramatically in the 2,000 years since gunpowder was invented. This interactive periodic table from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site highlights some of the elements used most frequently by people who create fireworks, and describes how they're used to create eye-popping effects.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Black powder is the oldest and most important chemical component of fireworks. This mixture of 15 percent charcoal (carbon), 10 percent sulfur, and 75 percent saltpeter (potassium nitrate) provides the fuel and the explosive force that carries fireworks high into the sky and causes them to burst in all their fiery brilliance. Like many chemical compounds, though, black powder produces only one color, a bright yellow flame, when it burns -- nothing like the rainbow of red, orange, green, blue, and violet displayed each Fourth of July in the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To produce more colorful displays, pyrotechnicians, the people who create fireworks, combine a wide variety of chemical ingredients into a single firework. Because of variations in atomic structure, different atoms give off different wavelengths of light after being heated in a flame. Strontium chloride, for example, burns with a red flame, while barium chloride produces a green flame. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The lifting charge, made of black powder, propels the firework skyward. As it travels higher and higher, a time-delay fuse burns. When the firework reaches its peak, the fuse ignites a charge or charges that blast the firework's "stars" -- individual, jawbreaker-sized pieces made up of these various chemicals -- into the beautiful patterns that audiences have come to expect. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In general, the components of a firework expand evenly when the firework explodes. Therefore, the placement of stars inside a firework determines their arrangement when the firework explodes. For example, a shell loaded with stars made of strontium chloride in the center and barium chloride around the perimeter will produce a flower-like display of red surrounded by green. By varying not just the type of chemical but also the size and configuration of stars used, nearly infinite color and pattern combinations are possible.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Which elements are used to fuel fireworks? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which elements are responsible for the colors we see in fireworks? What are two examples of elements and the colors they produce? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which elements are used to create effects?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, animations explain different aspects of the properties of metal.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site describes the crystalline structure of metal and uses animations to illustrate the molecular changes that occur when a metallic substance is bent, heated, or otherwise changed by external forces.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Metals consist of stacked layers of tightly packed, interacting atoms arranged in geometric patterns. Each of these atoms contains a small number of loosely held electrons in its outer shell. When metal atoms are close to one another, the outer-shell electrons don't orbit a particular nucleus; instead, they move freely among the atoms and form a negatively charged sea, or cloud, of electrons. This cloud surrounds the arrangement of positively charged nuclei and stable inner-electron shells and fixes them in position. The resulting material is tightly bound and physically strong. At the same time, the electron cloud is highly responsive to electric and magnetic forces, making metals good conductors of both heat and electric current, and also reflectors of light. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Metals may be strong, but because their crystalline structure is not perfect, they can be bent, twisted, stretched, and otherwise shaped. During the cooling process, when a metal changes from a liquid to a solid state, not one but many smaller crystals form, each with imperfections. Extra layers of atoms are squeezed in at some points, while other places may be missing atoms altogether or contain atoms of a different element. These imperfections become part of the metal when it solidifies and serve to weaken the bonds between some of the layers. When an external force is applied to the metal, these layers may shift more easily than those without imperfections. Typically, when an external force is removed, the layers shift back to their original positions. If the force is large enough or repeated too frequently, however, the shifting may become permanent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Metals are typically good thermal (heat) and electric conductors because electrons in the electron cloud move relatively freely and carry energy and electric charge as they do. Extreme heat, however, will melt metal because highly energized atoms move fast enough to break the bonds between them, thus softening the metal. The critical temperature, or melting point, is different for each type of metal.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What are the three main types of bonds that bind atoms together? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the relationship between heat and movement of atoms in a metal? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are some reasons metal objects are not uniformly strong in all places?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt;, learn about a type of exploding star &amp;mdash; a Type Ia supernova &amp;mdash; that is so bright that astronomers can measure the distance to the galaxy in which it resides, and even learn which elements make up the star.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt; Massive stars end their lives in colossal explosions called supernovae. Supernovae are rare events that represent the ultimate victory of gravity over matter. This interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; details the demise of a two-star system and its concluding event: a Type Ia supernova. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The most massive stars in the universe end their lives in cataclysmic explosions called supernovae. Of the four supernovae types, the two that occur most commonly are Type Ia and Type II supernovae. The more powerful Type Ia supernovae occur in what's called a binary system, in which a pair of stars orbit one another. By contrast, Type II supernova events involve very large individual stars called supergiants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any medium-mass or larger star, from one about 40 percent the size of the Sun to one several times greater, relies on energy produced in its core to offset the enormous force of gravity pulling matter toward its center. Nuclear fusion produces this sustaining energy. When hydrogen nuclei -- a star's primary fuel supply -- fuse with one another, helium nuclei are created. Although helium is heavier than hydrogen, the mass of the single helium nucleus is less than the total mass of the two hydrogen nuclei from which it formed. The difference is released as energy. A star will blaze away as long as there is enough hydrogen to fuel the reactions. Depending on its mass, this can range from a few million years for the most massive stars to several billion years for less massive stars, including the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A star between 0.5 and 1.4 times the size of our Sun does not explode when it has used up its fuel supply. Instead, it evolves into a smaller, denser, and cooler body called a white dwarf. After one of the stars in a binary system has become a white dwarf and the second star exhausts its fuel, the white dwarf's gravity field draws in the gases escaping from its dying companion. The white dwarf increases in mass until its core can no longer support itself, and it collapses in a huge explosion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supernovae are rare -- so rare that only three or four can be expected to occur in our galaxy each century. One was last observed in the Milky Way in 1604. However, thanks to continual improvements in telescope and instrument technology, astronomers can more easily detect and monitor supernovae in other galaxies. And although they cannot predict when a star will explode, observing the event and its aftermath can provide important clues to the workings of the universe. All Type Ia supernovae fade in a characteristic manner: rapidly at first, then more slowly. By analyzing the light they emit, scientists can measure distances to faraway galaxies and the speed at which the universe is expanding. They can also identify the elements from which the stars were made. And as the explosion fades to obscurity in a year or two, a gas remnant continues to mark where it occurred. From recent Hubble research, we know that Type Ia supernovae are not all of the same brightness, as was previously postulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how scientists analyze light spectra to determine the elements that comprise a star, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.origin/"&gt;The Origin of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about how certain elements are created in a star, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.fusion/"&gt;The Elements: Forged in Stars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about another kind of supernova, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.nova2/"&gt;Birth of a Supernova, Type II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

Why?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the different courses of events in the birth of Type Ia and Type II supernovae? What are the similarities between the two processes?

This interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA Online&lt;/em&gt; details the death of the most massive stars, which explode and become Type II supernovae. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;The most massive stars in the universe end their lives in cataclysmic explosions called supernovae. Of the four supernovae types, the two that occur most commonly are Type Ia and Type II supernovae. Type Ia supernovae occur in what's called a binary system, in which a pair of small stars orbit one another. By contrast, Type II supernova events involve very large individual stars called supergiants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any medium-mass or larger star, from one about 40 percent the size of our Sun to one several times greater, relies on energy produced in its core to offset the enormous force of gravity pulling matter toward its center. Nuclear fusion produces this sustaining energy. When hydrogen nuclei -- a star's primary fuel supply -- fuse with one another, helium nuclei are created. Although helium is heavier than hydrogen, the mass of the single helium nucleus is less than the total mass of the two hydrogen nuclei from which it formed. The difference is released as energy. A star will blaze away as long as there is enough hydrogen to fuel the reactions. Depending on its mass, this can range from a few million years for the most massive stars to several billion years for less massive stars, including the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a star at least four times more massive than our Sun runs out of hydrogen, gravity's influence becomes predominant, and the star's solid core begins to contract. As it contracts, it heats up. If it reaches a high enough temperature, a different type of fusion begins. At this point, the helium nuclei act as fuel and begin to fuse with one another. As the star swells to become a supergiant, the gravitational force is once again opposed by the outward pressure of energy from the material undergoing fusion. After the supply of helium is exhausted, the star repeats this process using the carbon and oxygen nuclei produced by helium fusion as its next source of fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cycle of producing and using heavier and heavier elements continues until all possible fuel sources are exhausted. When this happens, the core instantaneously collapses, and an enormous shock wave ripples outward through the star. This massive explosion, or supernova, jettisons solar gases and heavy elements into space. Depending on the size of the star, the remains of the collapsed core form either an incredibly dense, spinning neutron star or a black hole. Unlike Type Ia supernovae, which fade in a characteristic manner -- rapidly at first, then more slowly -- Type II supernovae fade differently from one event to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about another kind of supernova, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.nova1/"&gt;Birth of a Supernova, Type Ia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the remnants of a type II supernova, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.energy.sobell2/"&gt;Pulsars: Little Green Men&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about how certain elements are created in a star, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.fusion/"&gt;The Elements: Forged in Stars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes the discovery in the 1930s of two forces in addition to electromagnetism: the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, string theorist Brian Greene describes the discovery of two fundamental forces: the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force. He also explains why the discovery created a crisis of sorts in the search for a theory that could unite quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of the physical universe on a very small scale, and general relativity, which describes behavior on a very large scale.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>One of the most profound goals of modern theoretical physics is to describe the four fundamental forces in nature -- gravity, the electromagnetic force, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force -- with a single mathematical law. In 1915, Einstein published his theory of general relativity, which described gravity as not just a Newtonian force, but as a curvature in space-time. He then sought to broaden general relativity to encompass electromagnetism, the only other fundamental force known at the time, thereby simplifying scientific understanding of the universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; By the 1930s, while Einstein was still searching for this unifying theory, scientists probing the structure of the atom discovered two more fundamental forces: the strong nuclear force, which binds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom, and the weak nuclear force, which turns neutrons into protons, giving off radiation in the process. The field of quantum mechanics now provided a framework for understanding the universe on a very small scale, while general relativity explained behavior on a very large scale. However, scientists were at a loss to reconcile how the two different sets of laws describing nature at completely different scales could both be right. For example, to properly understand black holes required both general relativity &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; quantum mechanics, not simply one or the other. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; While Einstein ultimately failed at unifying gravity with electromagnetism, scientists in quantum mechanics were able to unify electromagnetism with the strong and weak nuclear forces. They discovered elementary particles of force called messenger particles; the exchange of these messenger particles creates what we experience as force. That the strong and weak nuclear forces and electromagnetism each possess messenger particles -- called gluons, weak gauge bosons, and photons, respectively -- meant these three forces could be described using the same mathematical language. Thus, quantum mechanics tells us how all of nature's forces work at the subatomic level -- except for the force of gravity. Even today, no one has ever discovered a similar messenger particle for gravity (a "graviton"), which would explain how gravity -- the odd man out -- operates at the level of atoms and subatomic particles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Learn in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/3012_elegant_02.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt; about the four fundamental forces and the interactions they govern.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Describe the two forces that were discovered in the 1930s. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did scientists harness the strong nuclear force to make the atomic bomb? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is the weak nuclear force "responsible for radioactivity"? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is gravity called "the odd man out" in this video resource?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Learn about the chemical reactions that take place when things burn in this interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site allows you to explore the basics of fire, including the complex molecular interactions between oxygen and other substances that cause combustion, or burning, as well as the chemical and physical properties of a flame.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The anatomy of a candle flame is complex, and both physical and chemical reactions are involved in producing it. In a room with still air, a flame hardly flickers. It burns at a fixed distance above a pool of melted wax. Everything is in balance, as wax is consumed, light emitted, and heat produced. Enclosed within the flame's bright yellow tongue is a dark cone that rises from below the curl of the wick. At the bottom of the flame -- around the wick but not quite touching it -- is a blue region of lesser brightness that seems to envelop the base of the dark and yellow regions above it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As a flame burns, heat radiates equally in all directions and melts the candle's solid wax into a hot liquid pool of usable fuel. Where the melted wax meets the heat of the flame, it evaporates, forming a gas. This vaporized fuel floats up from the wick and out to the edges of the dark zone. Here, wax vapor meets oxygen molecules from the air. This is the main reaction zone, where combustion takes place. Measuring about 1,400 degrees Celsius, this glowing blue region is the hottest part of a flame. The products of this combustion flow up into the yellow tongue of the flame, which is made up of carbon particles heated to incandescence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Fuel molecules that don't burn up right away -- because not enough oxygen is present -- combine to form particles called soot, which swirl around inside the body of the flame without actually burning. Eventually, though, most of the soot enters the reaction zone and burns blue like the rest of the fuel. But if the reaction zone is not very efficient, the soot may escape the flame without burning. Outside the flame, soot cools quickly and drifts upward as black smoke.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What are the steps that occur during the combustion of hydrogen? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the steps that occur during the combustion of methane? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Are we made of stars? This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; features scientists studying light emissions from exploding stars, called supernovas. Their observations and analyses can tell us the origin of the elements found on Earth and throughout the universe.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;All liquids, gases, and solids found on our planet are made from one or more of 92 naturally occurring elements. From what they have observed, scientists have determined that these same 92 elements are found throughout our universe. This suggests that a common process leads to their creation. But how are these elements created? How did they get they so widely disseminated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the most popular theory states that the nuclei of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements in the visible universe, were created in the moments following the Big Bang. All other naturally occurring elements were &amp;mdash; and continue to be &amp;mdash; generated in the high temperature and pressure conditions present in stars. Elements are composed of tiny particles called atoms that are indivisible under normal conditions. However, when exposed to high heat and pressure, atoms can either break apart or fuse together. Under these conditions, the nucleus of one element can fuse with the nucleus of a different element, creating the nucleus of a heavier element. When elements lighter than iron form, the mass of the new nucleus is less than the combined mass of the two original nuclei. The difference in mass between the two is released as energy. In stars, this kind of reaction is referred to as stellar nucleosynthesis, but it is more commonly known as nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is used today on Earth in the nuclear explosives called hydrogen bombs. Many people hope that one day nuclear fusion will be used for peaceful energy production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stars are fueled by nuclear fusion reactions, which take place in their deep interiors, or cores. Hydrogen nuclei fuse, forming helium nuclei. The energy produced by these fusion reactions prevents the star from collapsing under its own gravity. Mature stars contain enough hydrogen nuclei to last billions of years. When a star's hydrogen fuel supply is spent, however, its core begins to contract. The contraction is so intense that it creates conditions under which helium nuclei fuse. In this way, helium becomes the star's next fuel source. The fusion of helium nuclei produces carbon and oxygen nuclei, and in the process sufficient energy is released to temporarily sustain the star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once helium runs out, the nuclei of carbon, oxygen, and other elements begin to fuse. These new fuel sources are depleted at faster and faster rates. Since the heaviest element created in a star by nuclear fusion reactions is iron, a large iron core eventually forms at the center of everything. At this point, gravity becomes overwhelming, the core collapses, and an explosion occurs, during which outer layers of gas and heavy elements are ejected to space. Such explosions, called supernovas, occur about once a century in our galaxy. The energy created by supernovas produces nuclei heavier than iron. This process is known as supernova nucleosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long ago, scientists learned that they could heat atoms of an element to a glow and direct the light though a prism to produce a set of colored lines. These spectral lines are unique for each element: No two elements produce the same colors and line positions along a spectrum. By using instrumentation that reads light signatures from far away &amp;mdash; a technique known as spectroscopy &amp;mdash; scientists today know with great certainty which elements a planet or a star, or even a star's dispersed remnants, contains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the two primary kinds of supernovas, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.nova1/"&gt;Birth of a Supernova, Type Ia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.nova2/"&gt;Birth of a Supernova, Type II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about how certain elements are created in a star, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.fusion/"&gt;The Elements: Forged in Stars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about carbon, one of the universe's most common elements and the most important one for life on Earth, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.carbon/"&gt;Ingredients for Life: Carbon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2713_univers.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt; how scientists use indirect observations to infer conclusions about objects they cannot directly measure. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Where are elements created? How are heavier elements created from hydrogen and helium?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What evidence do scientists use to tell which elements are released when a supernova explodes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do the elements in the atmosphere of a supernova help scientists identify types of supernovas?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Meet chemistry professor Dr. John Conkling in this interview from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site and learn why fireworks are his passion.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In this interview from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, chemistry professor Dr. John Conkling details advancements made in color mixing, explains the limitations of aerial shell bursts, and suggests, among other things, that properly timing the bursts of fireworks is the key to thrilling an audience.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Dr. John Conkling is a university chemistry professor and a past executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association. In this wide-ranging interview, Conkling reflects on how the field of pyrotechnics has changed over time and reveals that innovations often come from amateurs who, like him, simply love to experiment with fireworks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; With booming noises and captivating visual displays, today's pyrotechnic productions offer something to appeal to almost everyone's taste. Thanks to advances in color mixing and other changes in their chemical makeup, fireworks have become brighter, more colorful, and more vivid over the past thirty years. In addition, computers are now programmed to control launch sequences, enabling displays -- although generally shorter than in the past -- to be jam-packed with rapid-fire shell bursts and timed to match musical selections. What's in store for the future of pyrotechnics? Conkling suggests that the next advances in pattern shell design may be complex shapes and fully formed words that light up the sky.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;How have fireworks changed over the past three decades? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the recent areas of innovation in the field of fireworks? What innovation would you like to see? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What safety concerns must be taken into consideration when using fireworks? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How are daytime firework displays possible? How are they different from nighttime displays? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; relates the rise of subatomic physics in the 1920s and the development of the radical theory of quantum mechanics.</annotation>
      <synopsis>The quantum world is unlike anything we experience in our daily lives. According to quantum theory, uncertainty isn't the exception, but the rule. In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, physicist Brian Greene describes what led to the theory of quantum mechanics and what life might be like if quantum rules governed our everyday world.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>When physicists first began investigating the structure of atoms in the early 1900s, they uncovered a strange new world. The subatomic particles they found -- electrons, protons, and neutrons -- seemed to behave according to a completely different set of laws than those governing our everyday world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Then, in the late 1920s, a team of young physicists led by Niels Bohr introduced a theory that explained the behavior of atoms and their particles. Not surprisingly, the theory, called quantum mechanics, was as bizarre as the world it attempted to explain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Rather than identifying precisely where an electron should be, for example, quantum mechanics predicts only the probability of finding that electron in one place or another. This description of unpredictability at the atomic level -- indeed, at any level -- was completely unacceptable to Einstein; it flew in the face of everything he believed, and directly contradicted his orderly theories of the universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Despite Einstein's disapproval, quantum mechanics has only grown in acceptance as a theory. According to present-day physicists, it is the only theory that successfully explains what is happening at the atomic level.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;How did our understanding of the atom change in the 1920s? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did quantum mechanics contradict Einstein's view of physics? What did Einstein mean when he said, "God does not throw dice"? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are some of the "bizarre" things that quantum mechanics predicts?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; shows how the particle accelerator helped physicists find parts of the atom even smaller than protons and neutrons.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Since no one has ever seen an atom, how are we able to know so much about atomic structure? Experimentation and inference have allowed scientists to develop the concepts of the nucleus and of electrons, protons, and neutrons. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; describes the evolution of atomic theory and explains what physicists are doing today to advance our understanding of the world's smallest particles.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Matter is all the &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; that we see, feel, and smell around us. By definition, matter has mass and takes up space. Matter includes substances such as water, wood, rock, metal, plastic, and air, as well as countless other materials. All types of matter are made up of tiny particles called atoms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Atoms and the sub-atomic particles they're made of are far too small to be seen, even with the most powerful microscope. Despite this, physicists have developed an understanding of the structure of these particles through experimentation and indirect observation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Models of the structure of atoms have changed a great deal since the first one -- a simple, undifferentiated sphere -- was proposed in the nineteenth century. In today's atomic model, a "cloud" of negatively charged particles called electrons orbits around a small, dense nucleus of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For many decades, physicists thought that protons, neutrons, and electrons were fundamental -- not made of anything smaller. While it appears that electrons are, in fact, fundamental, physicists now know that protons and neutrons, the particles that make up an atom's nucleus, contain even smaller particles called quarks. Scientists have identified six known quarks, which join together in groups of three to create either positively charged protons or neutral neutrons, depending on the specific combination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One of the most important tools for developing an understanding of atomic structure is the particle accelerator. This device accelerates particles until they move at almost the speed of light and contain a great deal of energy. Their paths are focused so that once their speed and energy are high enough they collide with other such particles. Devices called particle detectors, which surround the acceleration chamber, record the results of the particle collisions. The particle detectors can count the particles, categorize their tracks, measure their energy, record the length of their flight, and differentiate one particle from another. By analyzing all this data, physicists can determine the structure of the original particles.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What are quarks? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did scientists figure out that quarks exist? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What new technology developed by engineers helped the scientists learn more about quarks? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do science and engineering work together to learn more about our world and universe?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site puts the infinitesimally small world of string theory into perspective.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Science of the very large and of the very tiny is inherently difficult to understand. When something is too big or too small to be easily related to things in our visible world, how are we to imagine them, much less understand them? We need a better sense of scale. This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site attempts to bridge that gap by connecting the tangible world to the imperceptibly small world of strings.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>String theory is a revolutionary way of describing the world. It states that all aspects of our universe -- all the particles that make up matter, and all the forces that act on those particles -- are made up of tiny strings of energy. According to string theorists, these imperceptibly tiny strings, or loops, of energy hold the key to understanding and explaining the behavior of the smallest particles and the largest bodies in the universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; String theory is not so different from many earlier scientific theories. The objective of string theory and earlier theories of physics is what physicists call unification. The goal of unification is to describe unimaginably complex phenomena in the simplest possible terms, and to mathematically connect seemingly disparate physical concepts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Isaac Newton did exactly this when he developed his theory of gravity, which says that any two objects -- from the smallest to the largest -- exert an attractive force on each other. According to Newton's theory, the strength of this force depends on the mass of the objects and the distance between them. For over two hundred years, Newton's theory of gravity made it possible to unify our understanding of falling objects at the surface of Earth with the attraction between the Sun and planets in our solar system, as well as with many other diverse phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the twentieth century, Einstein set out to unify two concepts: his new and revised theory of gravity and electromagnetism. He wanted to prove mathematically that these two forces -- the only ones known at the time -- are governed by one underlying principle. However, shortly after he began this quest, the tide of theoretical physics swung toward quantum mechanics, and Einstein died without seeing the fulfillment of his dream of a unified field theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; String theory basically takes up where Einstein left off -- but with an even bigger objective: it attempts to attribute the properties of all fundamental particles and forces to the vibrations of strands of energy, called strings. String theory may one day prove to be the "theory of everything" that its proponents suggest, but even if it doesn't, at the very least, according to string theorist Brian Greene, if it is correct, this theory will provide the most solid foundation yet for truly understanding the universe.</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This illustrated essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site explains why the atomic structure of a diamond slows down light and produces a sparkle more brilliant than from any other colorless substance.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Light travels at 186,000 mi/sec in a vacuum, but when it travels through other media, its speed may be slower. In this illustrated essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, you'll learn how electrons in materials slow light passing through them, causing light to bend -- or refract -- when going from one material to another. You'll also learn how jewelers trap light to give a diamond its sparkle.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>When light meets an object, it may pass through the object with no effect, be absorbed by the object, or be reflected off the object. Light may also pass directly &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; certain objects, changing direction when it passes from one medium to another in the process. The name for this phenomenon is refraction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Refraction occurs when light leaves one transparent substance, such as air, and enters a second one through which it travels at a different speed. Because air, water, glass, and diamonds possess different densities and atomic structure, light refracts when it passes from one of these media to another. When light passes out again, it resumes the speed it was traveling before it entered the new medium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The atoms in a diamond are tightly packed with electrons -- so tightly that light travels at less than half the speed through the crystallized carbon as it does through air. In fact, no other transparent material slows light more than diamond. Jewelers use this unique property to temporarily trap light. They cut and polish diamond in its rough, natural state to produce a gem with smooth sides called facets. Light enters from all sides, and once inside, it bounces off several facets before leaving. The farther the light travels before leaving, the more it separates into the rainbow of colors that make it up. A diamond's dazzling sparkle, then, results from light's bouncing travel.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What can happen to the speed of light when it travels through matter? Is this the case with all matter? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do diamonds sparkle? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you think happens to the energy lost as light slows down? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think diamonds are so hard? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This illustrated timeline from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site follows Albert Einstein's life, including 1905, his "Miracle Year," during which he developed his Special Theory of Relativity and the equation, E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Albert Einstein, one of the world's most influential physicists, made more important scientific contributions in a single year than most scientists conceive of in a lifetime. This illustrated timeline from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site outlines some of the most important events of his life.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Albert Einstein experienced and contributed to many important events during his 50-year career as a theoretical physicist. Still, few moments had as great an impact on his life than a solar eclipse that occurred in March of 1919 -- and Einstein wasn't even there to see it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The eclipse, documented by British astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington off the west coast of Africa, was important because it helped prove Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One of Einstein's greatest, yet most abstract theories, the General Theory of Relativity, states that the force of gravity should affect light in much the same way it affects matter. The theory predicts that light should curve when in the presence of a strong gravitational field, such as the one created by our sun. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; While Einstein was convinced of the validity of his theory, and even predicted how it might be proved, many people, including other physicists, found no reason to suggest that it was true. Isaac Newton's conclusions that light always travels in a straight line had not been disproved in more than 200 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In March of 1919, however, Sir Arthur Eddington's observations and photographs changed all that. Einstein had predicted that, if it was possible to view stars whose light passes quite near the sun, they should appear to be in a different place than where they actually are. This is because the light they emit would be bent as it passed through the sun's gravitational field. To prove such an idea, however, would require seeing the stars in the presence of the sun, or during the day -- an impossibility, except during a solar eclipse. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Eddington's photographs, taken during the 1919 eclipse, showed stars nearest the sun in positions different from those they occupied at night, in the sun's absence. The pictures were proof that light could, in fact, be affected by gravity, providing an important step toward the general acceptance of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What major events occurred during Einstein's lifetime? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What effect, if any, did these events have on his life and work? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What were some of the great theories developed by Einstein? How have they changed our understanding of the cosmos?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive quiz from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site features an array of interesting facts about the nature of sound underwater.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Does sound travel faster in space than in water? Do whales of different species make similar sounds? Does warm water allow sound to travel faster? Learn more about how sound travels underwater by answering 10 true-or-false questions in this interactive quiz from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Sound waves transport energy from one location to another in a kind of chain reaction. An initiating event disturbs nearby molecules and pushes them into each other. In wavelike fashion, alternating regions of higher density (compressions) and lower density (rarefactions) move outward in all directions through a solid, liquid, or gas medium. As with other types of waves, such as surface waves in water, it's not the medium or material carrying the waves that moves outward; rather, what moves is the disturbance in the material itself. The material then returns to the position it was in before the wave came by. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Sound waves move faster through a denser medium partly because energy is more easily passed, or conducted, between tightly packed molecules. This helps explain why the speed of sound in water is about five times faster than the speed of sound in air. Interestingly, sound can't travel at all in space because space is a vacuum containing no molecules, or almost none. Electromagnetic waves, such as light and radio waves, can travel through empty space because, unlike sound, they are self-sustaining, and no material or medium must vibrate for them to exist. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Perhaps even more influential than a conducting medium's density is its elasticity. Elasticity refers to how well a medium can return to its original form after being disturbed. Generally speaking, the stronger the bond between a medium's molecules, the higher its elasticity. At the particle level, molecules bounce right back to their original positions after an applied force is removed. Because the molecules in such highly elastic materials as steel transfer energy more efficiently, sound waves travel at higher speed through them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fact that water is a relatively good sound conductor explains why many marine animals have adapted to life underwater in ways that emphasize sound. Dolphins and whales, probably more than any other marine animals, have developed a sophisticated use of sound. Not only do they hear extremely well, but many have also evolved vocalizations specialized for communication, navigation, and locating food. Fish also make sounds underwater.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Explain why sound travels faster in water than in the air. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain why sound doesn't travel in space. How do astronauts communicate? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the sound that you hear when you listen to a seashell? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why does knowing that the speed of sound changes with water temperature help scientists who are studying global warming trends? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you think of other ways that scientists use the measurement of sound traveling through water to study natural phenomena? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you think of other sources of sound in the ocean that aren't mentioned in the quiz? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>How does an airplane stay aloft when upside down? This media-rich essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site offers an explanation based on Newton's third law of motion.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Bernoulli's principle, an important principle of fluid dynamics, is often used to explain what causes lift, the upward force that keeps an airplane or glider in flight. This media-enhanced essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site presents an additional explanation of lift, based on Newton's third law of motion, which holds that in order to produce lift a wing must push air down.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>To get an airplane airborne or climbing in flight, its wings must produce more lift than the total weight of the aircraft. One popular explanation for how this happens is based on Bernoulli's principle, which describes the relationship between the velocity and pressure exerted by a fluid in motion. It states that as the velocity of a fluid increases, the pressure exerted by that fluid decreases, and vice versa. For most planes, the wings, viewed in profile, are curved on top and flat on the bottom. As air passes over the wing, it has further to travel and moves faster than the air passing beneath the wing. According to Bernoulli, this creates a difference in pressure that results in a net upward force. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; But that explanation may be incomplete because it doesn't state, for one thing, why air moving above and beneath a wing must meet at the wing's trailing edge. An alternative, perhaps even complementary, explanation calls on Newton's third law of motion: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The focus here is on the tilt of the wing, called its angle of attack, and its influence on airflow. It holds that as a wing is tilted upward, it generates more lift. This is because more air molecules strike the bottom surface of the wing and get deflected downward. This in turn transfers upward momentum to the wing. Thus, if the angle of attack is increased, the plane rises; if it is decreased, the plane descends. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Airfoil is a term for the cross-section of an airplane wing. While thick airfoils provide lots of lift, they also produce lots of drag, a force that tends to slow the motion of a plane through the air. For this reason, planes with thick airfoils are not well suited for high-speed or long-duration flight. Thin airfoils, by contrast, minimize drag and are both fast and fuel-efficient. Fighter jet wings are almost symmetrical: the curve of the upper surface is almost identical to the curve on the bottom surface. This results in less lift compared with other wing profiles. To compensate, the plane has to move through the air at high speed to stay aloft.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Why does the illustration at the beginning of the essay provide an incomplete explanation of what causes lift? What is missing? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does Newton' third law of motion help explain what causes lift? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is the shape of an airplane's wing important?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, NASA learns hard lessons from the first American attempt to do work while "walking" in space. The video also explores Newton's third law of motion.</annotation>
      <synopsis>The sensation of "weightlessness" that orbiting astronauts experience on their missions would seem to make their tasks almost effortless. However, as Newton's third law of motion suggests, working in space can be physically demanding. This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, illustrates the significance of Newton's law to space-walking astronauts and the engineers who design their spacecrafts.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>One of NASA's first attempts at a "space walk" turned into an exhausting failure for astronaut Gene Cernan. Unlike astronauts who had "walked" in space on previous missions, Cernan had several tasks to accomplish outside the spacecraft. However, every time he attempted to push or turn a valve, he was sent hurtling in the opposite direction, with little control over his trajectory. After many exhausting minutes, his mission outside the capsule was called off, and NASA scientists began trying to figure out what went wrong. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; NASA scientists and engineers should probably have predicted that if an astronaut applied force to open or close a valve, the valve would apply the same amount of force to him, but in the opposite direction. After all, nearly 300 years ago, Isaac Newton presented what came to be known as his third law of motion, which says that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. We experience these conditions on Earth; if we lean heavily against a wall, the wall pushes back with a force equal and opposite to our lean. (To illustrate the wall's opposing force more vividly, imagine leaning against it while wearing roller skates.) On Earth, gravity and friction provide the stability we need to resist the forces exerted on us during everyday tasks. In contrast, orbiting astronauts must struggle against conditions of "weightlessness." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Orbiting astronauts never actually experience "zero gravity, " even though they commonly use this term to describe the sensation of "weightlessness." In fact, at an altitude of 320 kilometers (200 miles), Earth's gravitational pull is about 90 percent of what it is on the planet's surface, meaning that an orbiting spacecraft and its passengers weigh about 90 percent of their weight on the ground. The sensation of "weightlessness" is the result of the spacecraft's constant state of free-fall around Earth. The spacecraft travels at about 7.5 km (4.7 miles) per second. At this speed, gravity continues to pull the spacecraft toward Earth, but the surface of the Earth also curves away from the spacecraft. As a result, the spacecraft continuously falls at a rate that matches this curvature. The spacecraft is always falling, but from its perspective, so is the surface of the Earth. To the astronauts, it seems as though gravity has disappeared even though it is still very much present. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To combat "weightlessness," NASA engineers began to equip spacecrafts with footholds and handholds to give space-walking astronauts the stability they need to perform work.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What is Newton's third law of motion? How did it affect Gene Cernan? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What solution helps astronauts work in space now? Why? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is meant by "zero gravity?" By "weightlessness?" Is there really no gravity in space? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Survey potential bridge sites, research bridge design, and select the right bridge for the right location in this interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site highlights the strengths and weaknesses of various bridge designs. It then challenges you to put your knowledge to the test by situating the right type of bridge in each of four different scenarios.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>An engineer's masterful grasp of physics, the properties and availability of various building materials, and construction techniques have made it possible to build modern bridges that carry heavier loads, span greater distances, and use less material than ever before. In determining which of the basic bridge designs to use when building a bridge, an engineer must consider, among other things, the length of the span, the surrounding terrain, the bridge's intended use, and the cost of materials and labor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Beam bridges, the simplest and most cost-effective kind of span, consist of beams made of wood, iron, or steel -- the stiffer, the better -- laid horizontally atop evenly spaced supports called piers. Although single-beam bridges rarely span longer than 200 feet, bridges made by joining several beams can run almost endlessly. Stiffening trusses may be added to help the bridge support heavier loads. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Arch bridges, typically steel or stone structures, are easily identified by their graceful, curved shape. Capable of spanning longer distances -- 200 to 800 feet -- without the use of intermediate support piers, these compressive structures can be built high over deep rivers or gorges. Fixed supports, called abutments, at each end of an arch prevent it from spreading apart at its base. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A suspension bridge's signature features -- its long steel cables and rising towers -- support the weight of a suspended deck and the traffic it's designed to carry. The cables are anchored at each end of the bridge into solid concrete blocks, which pull on the suspension cables and keep them taut. Capable of spanning more than a mile, suspension bridges are often used over large bodies of water, like harbor entrances. Because suspension bridges typically have only two foundational piers, on top of which the towers stand, obstacles to shipping activity passing below the deck are minimized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Cable-stayed bridges are similar in some ways to suspension bridges but differ in how they support a roadway. In both designs, the towers support the entire weight of the roadway. But close inspection reveals that in a cable-stayed bridge, the roadway is directly linked to the towers by large, high-tension cables. In a suspension bridge, however, the roadway is connected first to smaller, vertical suspension cables and those are then connected to the long steel cables that drape over the towers and anchor at both ends of the bridge.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Draw sketches for each type of bridge. Can you illustrate the compression and tension (pushes and pulls) in each? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is one type of bridge better than another for a given location/geography? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How might engineers adapt bridges to more complex locations? What factors might make an engineer combine some of the bridge types?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, discover how centripetal force can affect you when riding in a car or flying at high speeds in a fighter jet.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site explains centripetal force, the force that keeps your car from driving off the road when rounding a corner. The activity also reveals how much force a fighter pilot's body can withstand before he or she loses consciousness.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>When an object moves in a circle, which is effectively what a car does when it rounds a bend in the road, the moving object must be pulled or pushed inward toward what's called the center of rotation. It's this force acting toward the center -- the centripetal force -- that keeps an object moving along a curved path. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Centripetal force prevents moving objects from exiting a curve and flying off in a straight line by continuously making them change their direction toward the center of rotation. Gravity plays an important role in this. On Earth, gravity applies a constant downward force on all objects. For a turning car, the downward force of gravity is matched by the upward force provided by the surface over which the tires roll. So gravity creates the conditions for the friction between the tires and the ground so that, in turn, the ground can provide the push (that is, the centripetal force) needed for the car to turn. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Often, people confuse centripetal force with centrifugal force. The sensation passengers (or even fighter pilots) experience that makes them feel like they're actually being pushed away from the center of rotation -- or "thrown" -- during a sharp turn is commonly referred to as centrifugal force, although it isn't a force at all. It's the result of observing one's motion relative to the object in which one is traveling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To better understand the distinction, put yourself in a passenger's situation. When a car you're riding in suddenly changes direction (for example, takes a sharp turn to the left), your body continues to travel in the same direction it was traveling in before the abrupt shift. As with the rest of the car, the passenger door starts to move in a circle due to centripetal force. To continue your motion in a straight line, you would have to go through the door. As a result, you will find yourself pressed against the passenger door. If you were to observe your motion relative to the car, however, you'd realize that you're actually being pushed by the door inward to the center of rotation, thus prevented from moving in the same direction you had been traveling.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;A force is a push or a pull. Describe centripetal force in terms of pushes or pulls and the direction of the force. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are a passenger in a car moving forward, describe your motion and that of the car if the car makes a sudden, sharp, right-hand turn. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is a centrifuge? What is it used for in the laboratory? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do scientists test the effects on the human body of forces in flight? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is meant by a 1 G force?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site challenges you to think like Einstein and understand how time travel might be possible.</annotation>
      <synopsis>When Albert Einstein published his special theory of relativity in 1905, although it wasn't his goal, he laid out the foundation for the theoretical possibility of time travel. This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site presents the concepts Einstein used in special relativity, namely that the speed of light is constant for any observer, moving or not, and that because this is true, time can vary.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>In investigating the consequences of James Clerk Maxwell's equations of electromagnetics, Albert Einstein developed a theory that shows how light waves are observed to behave in different frames of reference. One of the consequences of Maxwell's equations -- and a foundation of special relativity -- is that the speed of a light wave is constant: 300,000 km/sec, no matter what reference frame it is observed in. Einstein built on Maxwell's equations and established that time is not unchangeable, as nearly everyone preceding him had thought. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Einstein later developed a general theory of relativity that explains gravity and the geometry of the universe. In both of his relativity theories, he established that time and space are bound together in a four-dimensional "space-time" continuum. Space-time consists of the three coordinates of space -- up-down, left-right, and backward-forward -- plus one of time, and events can only be analyzed and understood in a system in which space and time are linked in fascinating ways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; These theories show that time travel to the future is, in a certain sense, possible. Time passes at different rates in two separate reference frames that are moving with respect to one another. In principle, it is possible for two people to travel in separate directions and return to the same place with more time having passed for one of them than for the other. Whether or not this constitutes travel into the future, however, is a matter of interpretation. In addition, atomic clocks have been used to prove that the warping effect of gravity changes the way time is measured, which is a tenet of general relativity. In order to get significant effects from either of these relativistic effects, however, very fast speeds or strong gravitational fields are required. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; But since Einstein's conclusions -- and, indeed, even long before then -- people have considered how one might travel through time, and the implications of such travel. Contrary to popular conceptions, most theories of time travel do not rely on time machines. Instead, proponents suggest that time travel will likely be done by way of entirely speculative natural phenomena -- things like rotating black holes, wormholes, and cosmic strings -- that will transport us instantly forward or backward from one point in time to another.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;As a group, come up with a description of time travel. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What evidence is there that time can vary? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you think velocities simply add up until you reach the speed of light, or might there be small differences even for lower velocities? Explain your answer. &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, showcases the competing engineering plans designed for landing a person on the Moon for the first time.</annotation>
      <synopsis>During the Apollo 11 mission, Neil Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the Moon. This video, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, details the three competing mission plans considered for landing a manned spacecraft on the lunar surface and focuses on how the Moon's low-gravity conditions and lack of atmosphere influenced the design and manufacture of the landing craft.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Lunar-orbit rendezvous, the mission plan selected to land the first human on the Moon, involved launching a rocket comprised of a command module, a landing module, and a service module carrying fuel and the main propulsion system. Once in Earth orbit, the last stage of the rocket would send the remaining components and crew to the Moon. Once in lunar orbit, the command module would deploy the smaller landing module to the Moon's surface. The smaller module would both save on fuel and execute a more agile landing under the conditions of the Moon's surface, which are very different from those on Earth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Because the lunar lander would be jettisoned once it re-docked with the orbiting command module, design engineers could tailor it exclusively for space flight. Unlike Earth, the Moon has no significant atmosphere. Its dusty, cratered surface is subjected to enormous temperature swings (up to 280 degrees Celsius). Most notable is its weaker gravitational force. Overcoming gravity on Earth requires a great deal of fuel and good aerodynamic design, but on the Moon there is little gravity to overcome, so the requirements are different. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Thus, engineers involved in the Apollo 11 mission could ignore aerodynamic considerations for the lander. However, they could not ignore weight. To fuel both the descent and the ascent of the lander, three pounds of fuel for every pound of weight would be needed. Throughout the design process, then, engineers considered the weight of every component and seized upon every weight-reduction opportunity that would not compromise crew safety. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Since the flight would be brief and the impact of landing moderate, engineers designed the lander's interior without seats. Because the lack of atmosphere ruled out frictional drag, the lander's outer "skin" could be thin and lightweight and its shape practical, with no need for streamlining. In place of rigid heat shields, a wrapping of thin, lightweight aluminum-mylar foil would protect the craft from intense solar radiation, saving about 110 pounds. Although on Earth the lander would be fragile, its design would be strong enough for the low-gravity, no-atmosphere conditions at the surface of the Moon.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;How are the conditions of the Moon's surface different from those on Earth? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why was it important to limit the weight of the lunar lander? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did the Moon's lack of atmosphere influence the design of the lander? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think NASA didn't test more that one solution? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does this story show the importance of basic scientific principles in the engineering design process? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Discover the difference between free-falling and weightlessness in this interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Images of astronauts cavorting in the weightless conditions they experience in orbit have led many to believe that there's no gravity in space. This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site explains how free-falling can result in a sense of weightlessness and, more importantly, how astronauts can free-fall for so long!</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>When we hear the word &lt;em&gt;weightless&lt;/em&gt;, it's hard not to think of astronauts floating around in space. Surprisingly, however, an object does not need to be in outer space to experience the sensation of weightlessness. In fact, being in space, by itself, does not make a spacecraft or its occupants weightless. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The weight of an object is a function of its mass -- essentially how much stuff it's made of -- and how far it is from the center of a very large object, like Earth. All else being equal, the more mass an object has, the more it will weigh. Also, the closer an object is to Earth, the more it will weigh. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The space shuttle orbits at an altitude of about 320 kilometers (200 miles) above Earth's surface. At this distance, the spacecraft and the astronauts still weigh about 90 percent as much as they do on the ground. That is, the force of Earth's gravity acting on them is still 90 percent as strong as if they were standing on the ground. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; So, the astronauts experience weightlessness not because there is no gravity. Rather, weightlessness occurs because they and their spacecraft are free-falling in gravity. When two objects fall freely, one can float inside the other until they both reach the ground. The astronauts float inside the space shuttle just water might float inside a falling cup -- even if that cup had holes in it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; But what keeps the space shuttle from free-falling to Earth's surface and crashing into it? A spacecraft can maintain its free-fall for a very long period of time by traveling fast enough -- about 7.5 kilometers (4.7 miles) per second -- horizontally, so that even though it is constantly being pulled toward Earth's surface, its free-fall path is parallel to the planet's curvature.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Why do astronauts float when orbiting Earth? Does gravity play a role? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is meant by "weightlessness"? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can the length of a free-fall be extended? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you think of ways to simulate free-fall here on Earth? How?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site samples Galileo's experiments with falling objects, projectiles, inclined planes, and pendulums.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Galileo's intelligence and ingenuity seemed to know no bounds. With a few simple yet elegant experiments and "thought experiments," Galileo single-handedly overturned centuries-old beliefs about the physical world. This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site allows users to conduct some of Galileo's most important experiments.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The motion of objects fascinated Galileo throughout his life. When he wasn't conducting real-world experiments, he developed "thought experiments" to test his ideas about the way objects move, and why. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Centuries before Galileo revolutionized this area of physics, Aristotle concluded that objects of greater mass fall faster than those with less mass. This can certainly be observed with many of the objects we see around us every day. A dropped piece of paper, for example, drifts to the ground far more slowly than a falling soccer ball. However, Galileo suspected that Aristotle's universally accepted theory may not have been true. He predicted that differences in acceleration between different types of falling objects had nothing to do with either mass or Earth's gravitational force. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In several experiments and "thought experiments" Galileo recorded many hypotheses and observations and found evidence to support the possibility of a universal law governing the motion of all falling objects. Galileo probably dropped and threw countless objects from high places. Certainly, he thought about doing so under a variety of conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Galileo also measured the time it took for pendulums of different weights to swing back and forth and the acceleration of balls rolling down inclined planes of different lengths. In the end, he concluded that the effect of gravity on earthly objects is the same, regardless of the mass of those objects. He argued that in the absence of other forces such as air resistance, all falling objects accelerate toward Earth at the same rate. In the centuries since Galileo's time, physicists have verified his conclusion and determined the rate of acceleration at Earth's surface to be 9.8 meters a second for every second the object is in free-fall.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Why do you think Galileo's ideas and experiments seemed surprising or difficult to believe at the time? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is meant by a "thought experiment?" &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did Galileo use "thought experiments" to understand gravity? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the motion of a pendulum, first using words, then adding sketches, and finally adding mathematics. From this experience, discuss why mathematics was so important to Galileo's discoveries. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Has this resource helped you understand how objects move? How? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try these experiments yourself. How do your results compare with Galileo's? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This illustrated timeline from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site turns back the clock to the late 1500's to relive the dramatic life of one of the world's most renowned scientists.</annotation>
      <synopsis>While Galileo is one of the world's most renowned scientists, not many of us know much about his life. This illustrated timeline from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site chronicles Galileo's life -- his education, scientific and mathematical observations, and relationship with the Catholic church. It highlights events from his birth in 1564, to the creation of his own three-powered telescope in 1609, to his death, while under house arrest, in 1642.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Perhaps Galileo ought to have recognized that his teaching of Copernican theory -- that the Sun, not Earth, was the center of the universe -- would not be tolerated by the leaders of the Roman Catholic church. After all, the Church, feeling threatened by the spread of Protestantism through Europe at the end of the sixteenth century, had revived the Inquisition, a tribunal to protect against heresy that was first assembled in the thirteenth century. Already, a monk named Giordano Bruno had been convicted of heresy for stating his belief in a Sun-centered universe; he was burnt to death in 1600. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The observations Galileo made from 1609 to 1610 with the telescope he had built provided proof, he thought, that Copernican theory was correct. Brought to Rome in 1615 to testify about his views, Galileo was formally warned not to teach this theory as fact. He accepted this warning and managed to disguise any defense of Copernican theory in his published works until 1632, when after many years of work, he published &lt;em&gt;Dialogue on the Two Great Systems of the World&lt;/em&gt;. Accused of advocating Copernican theory in his astronomical findings, thus violating the Church's earlier decree, Galileo was sentenced by the Inquisition to house arrest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Church's main concern was not with the science behind Galileo's theories. In fact, many members of the council of theologians entrusted to protect the Church were actually scientists and mathematicians who agreed with his conclusions. What they were unable to tolerate, however, was Galileo's publishing his theories as fact, even after an explicit order from the pope not to do so. Though he was nearing 70 at the time of his sentencing and on the verge of blindness, Galileo continued his work. He completed a book that for the first time summarized his earlier work on mechanics -- the study of forces acting on bodies in motion and at rest -- which laid the foundations for classical physics.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;How old was Galileo when he made some of his important discoveries? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who financed Galileo's scientific work? How is scientific work financed now? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did the religious beliefs at the time influence how Galileo's work was received? Do you think religion influences scientific ideas now? If yes, can you give an example? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What measuring tools did Galileo have for his motion experiments? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What tools are available today? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Even great scientists make mistakes! This illustrated essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site looks at Galileo's theory of the tides, which, while well thought out, was wrong.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Galileo sought and found empirical evidence for many prominent scientific theories of his time. Many of his discoveries and explanations are still cherished for their accuracy and elegance. Galileo's explanation for the ocean tides, however, isn't one of them. This essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site describes the observations and conclusions that came to be known as "Galileo's Big Mistake."</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>A widely held view during Galileo's time connected movements of the Moon to the rise and fall of the tides. However, prior to Newtonian physics and recognition of the law of gravitation, which says that all objects are attracted to and by all other objects, an explanation for the Moon's effect on Earth's oceans was lacking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Physicists now know that just as Earth's gravity pulls at the Moon, keeping it in orbit around our planet, the Moon also pulls at Earth. This pull causes ocean water to bulge on the side of Earth nearest the Moon. Surprisingly, it makes the water bulge on the other side of Earth at the same time. The simplest way to understand the two bulges is to realize that the Moon's gravitational pull is strongest on the water closest to the Moon, a bit weaker on the solid Earth and weaker still on the water on the far side of Earth. In essence, the Moon is both pulling the water that is closest to it away from Earth and pulling Earth away from the water on the far side. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Because Earth turns on its axis, making a full rotation every 24 hours, different points on Earth's surface are subject to these forces at different times. Nearest the Moon, ocean waters bulge and tides rise. As Earth's rotation continues away from the Moon's gravitational pull, tides recede, only to rise again about 12 hours later on the side of Earth, opposite the Moon. Because the Moon orbits Earth in the same direction as Earth spins on its axis (though much more slowly), each high and low tide arrives about 25 minutes later than the previous day's tides.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What was Galileo's "big mistake"? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What everyday experience led Galileo to his explanation of the tides? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What actually causes the tides? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you think incorrect theories help or hinder the development of scientific ideas? Explain. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you think of another example of a scientific explanation that was reasonable given the tools and knowledge at the time but was later disproved by new evidence? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did Galileo move the scientific process forward? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Einstein called Galileo the "father of modern physics." This media-rich essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site looks at Galileo's quest to understand the mathematics of motion.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This media-rich essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site dispels some myths surrounding Galileo and highlights the significance of his observations, experiments, and analyses. It focuses in particular on his measurements of motion.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Dava Sobel, the author of &lt;em&gt;Galileo's Daughter: A Historical Memoir of Science, Faith, and Love&lt;/em&gt;, contributed this essay, which uses video and text to recount Galileo's contributions to science and to explain how he reconciled his religious beliefs with his sometimes-contradictory experimental results. The essay also includes insights into the combativeness that existed between natural philosophers in the Aristotelian tradition and mathematically-oriented physicists like Galileo. Putting Galileo's life in perspective -- his inventiveness served him well in an age of technological infancy -- it's easy to understand why Albert Einstein, in honoring both his contributions to astronomy and physics and his role as pioneer and visionary, called Galileo the "father" of modern science.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;How did describing the "how" rather than the "why" of motion move scientific understanding forward? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think Einstein called Galileo the "father" of modern science? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>How did Galileo figure out the mathematics of falling bodies? This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; examines Galileo's work on motion.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Galileo's use of the inclined plane to study the motion of objects is one of his most important contributions to science. As this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; illustrates, the inclined plane allowed Galileo to accurately measure the effect of gravity on falling objects and develop a universal law describing this effect.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Galileo thought a great deal about the motion of falling objects. Specifically, he was interested in the forces that acted upon objects in free-fall and whether those forces affect different types of objects differently. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In Galileo's time, Aristotle's centuries-old assertion that heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects was almost universally accepted. Even today, most people would predict that a feather will drift to the ground more slowly than a hammer, but they might not be able to explain why. Galileo acknowledged this difference in falling time, but wondered if it was due to the mass of the objects and gravity's pull on that mass, or to some other force that was being overlooked. For years, he conducted real-world experiments and "thought experiments" to test his ideas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Most falling objects move quickly. Even with a modern stopwatch, it is difficult to accurately measure an object's free-fall velocity or its rate of acceleration. Having no such timepiece, Galileo might have considered a study of falling objects impossible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; However, Galileo was nothing if not ingenious. He had the idea that a ball rolling down an incline would accelerate in the same way as a free-falling object, but more slowly. Using a straight, gently sloped piece of wood with a groove running down the center -- an inclined plane -- he was able to "dilute" gravity's effect. The inclined plane thus allowed Galileo to accurately measure acceleration with simple instruments and ultimately to prove that, in the absence of other forces such as air resistance, gravity causes all falling objects to accelerate toward Earth at the same rate.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;How did Galileo slow down motion so he could measure the motion of a falling object? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make a chart that shows the pattern Galileo discovered when he measured the units of distance a falling object covers in each unit of time. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use a sketch to explain what "this beautiful numerical progression--one, three, five, seven" means. What is special about the sums of odd integers? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do the 50 stars on the American flag fit so well? Try adding up the rows of stars, starting in a corner. Notice the sequence 1+3+5+ and so on. Why does it stop at 9? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>How can Earth move through space without our feeling its motion? This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; answers this question by dramatizing one of Galileo's thought experiments.</annotation>
      <synopsis>The heliocentric theory holds that Earth moves around the Sun at great speed, a controversial idea in Galileo's time. Even today, many people are still perplexed by the fact that we don't experience any sense of this motion. This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, shows a dramatization of one of Galileo's thought experiments designed to help prove heliocentric theory.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Today, we know that Earth completes an orbit around the Sun every 365 days and moves at more than 100,000 km/hour. Copernicus, a sixteenth-century Polish astronomer, was the first to place the Sun at the center of the universe. His heliocentric theory contradicted geocentric theory, the long-held belief that Earth was fixed at the center of the universe and that all other bodies, including the Sun, revolved around it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; If Earth was indeed moving at great speed, why did it seem to all senses to be motionless? Galileo developed a thought experiment to answer this question. Thought experiments are hypothetical scenarios that generally cannot be tested due to practical considerations. In this thought experiment, Galileo began by thinking that a ball dropped by a rider atop a stationary horse falls straight down beside the horse. Even if the horse is galloping and the ball is dropped, it lands beside the horse -- just as when the horse is stationary. How can this be? Because, Galileo reasoned, the forward motion of the horse (which represents Earth) is communicated to the ball through the rider's hand. In other words, the ball moves in the same direction and at the same speed as the horse and will always fall beside the horse when dropped. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Galileo concluded that all objects on Earth and within its atmosphere share in its motion. As a result, they are unaffected by its motion, just as if they were stationary. Ironically, Galileo's thought experiment involving the horse and rider could easily have been tested, but he was so certain of the results that he never did it.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What is a thought experiment? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which aspects of Galileo's thought experiment work as a model for Earth's movement and which do not? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you pour a glass of water at home or on an airplane is the movement of the water the same or different? Why? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have you ever drunk or eaten something in a car? Were there any problems? Why or why not? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What happens when a car speeds up, stops suddenly, or goes around a corner? Does our awareness of movement change then? Explain. &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this audio resource from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, astronaut Gene Cernan recounts his harrowing experience during America's first attempt to do work in outer space.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Being an astronaut in orbit looks easy. Under conditions of "weightlessness," they seem to float about their spacecraft effortlessly, somersaulting and gulping beverages out of midair. However, as one of the first astronauts to "walk" in space recounts in this audio clip from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, there's nothing easy about working in space.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>One of NASA's first attempts at a "space walk" turned into an exhausting failure for astronaut Gene Cernan. Unlike astronauts who had "walked" in space on previous missions, Cernan was assigned several work tasks to be performed outside the spacecraft. Each time he attempted to push or turn a valve, he was sent hurtling in the opposite direction with little control over his trajectory. After many frustrating minutes, his mission outside the capsule was called off, and NASA scientists began trying to figure out what went wrong. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; NASA scientists and engineers should probably have predicted that if an astronaut applied force to open or close a valve, the valve would apply the same amount of force to him, but in the opposite direction. After all, nearly 300 years ago, Isaac Newton presented what came to be known as his third law of motion, which says that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. We experience these conditions on Earth; if we lean heavily against a wall, the wall pushes back with a force equal and opposite to our lean. (To illustrate the wall's opposing force more vividly, imagine leaning against it while wearing roller skates.) On Earth, gravity and friction provide the stability we need to resist the forces exerted on us during everyday tasks. In contrast, orbiting astronauts must struggle against conditions of "weightlessness". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Orbiting astronauts never actually experience "zero gravity," even though they commonly use this term to describe the sensation of weightlessness. In fact, at an altitude of 320 kilometers (200 miles), Earth's gravitational pull is about 90 percent of what it is on the planet's surface, meaning that an orbiting spacecraft and its passengers weigh about 90 percent of their weight on the ground. The sensation of weightlessness is the result of the spacecraft's constant state of free-fall around Earth. The spacecraft travels at about 7.5 kilometers (4.7 miles) per second. At this speed, gravity continues to pull the spacecraft toward Earth, but the surface of the Earth also curves away from the spacecraft. As a result, the spacecraft continuously falls at a rate that matches this curvature. The spacecraft is always falling, but from its perspective, so is the surface of the Earth. To the astronauts, it seems as though gravity has disappeared even though it is still very much present. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To combat weightlessness during subsequent missions, NASA engineers equipped spacecraft with footholds and handholds that would give space-walking astronauts the stability they needed to perform work.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What is Newton's third law of motion? How did it affect Gene Cernan? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does Cernan describe the characteristics of the environment in which he found himself in space? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is meant by "zero gravity"? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What simple solution helps astronauts work in space now? How does this help? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose an example of an everyday activity, such as brushing your teeth. What challenges would you face if you had to do this activity in a spacecraft orbiting Earth? What would you do to meet those challenges? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; chronicles Einstein's quest to unify the forces of electromagnetism and gravity.</annotation>
      <synopsis>On the heels of his revolutionary general theory of relativity, Einstein set out to conquer an even greater challenge: to unify the forces of gravity and electromagnetism in one theory. In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, physicist Brian Greene explains Einstein's thinking behind this bold idea -- and what got in the way of Einstein's creation of a "theory of everything."</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>In his general theory of relativity, Einstein reworked Newton's 250-year-old theory of gravity. In doing so, he started a revolution in the world of physics. Gravity didn't act on objects instantaneously, as Newton suggested; rather, Einstein said, it travels in waves at precisely the speed of light. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This piece of information -- gravity's speed -- suggested to Einstein the possibility of symmetry between gravity and electromagnetism, as well as a way to unify these two disparate forces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; But there was something Einstein wasn't able to reconcile: that gravity and electromagnetism are exceedingly different in strength. As physicist Brian Greene illustrates so spectacularly in this video segment, electromagnetism is actually billions and billions of times stronger than gravity. Until recently, it seemed that this difference in strength outweighed any similarities between the two forces. Today, some physicists believe that string theory has the power to explain the relationship among all forces and uncover the commonality between gravity and electromagnetism that Einstein couldn't see.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What did Einstein hope to do to further his quest for a "theory of everything"? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What prevents the man in the video segment from crashing through the sidewalk? How do the electrons of the man interact with the electrons of the sidewalk? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does the force of gravity compare to that of electromagnetism?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This media-rich series of interviews from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site explores the unique challenges faced by astronauts doing construction work in outer space.</annotation>
      <synopsis>It's not all fun and games walking in space. While astronauts are free from the force of gravity, they struggle against other forces, ones we also experience here on Earth, but seldom notice. In these media-rich interviews from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site, NASA astronauts describe the difficulties of working in space and some of the strategies and equipment they use to overcome them.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>NASA's first attempts at sending astronauts outside their spacecrafts to "walk" and perform tasks quickly turned into exercises in frustration and fear. Each time an astronaut attempted to turn a valve or bolt, he was sent hurtling in the opposite direction with little control over his trajectory. Following the early termination of several such attempts, NASA scientists set out to determine what was happening and, more importantly, how to help future astronauts overcome the effects of their own actions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Nearly 300 years before the first space mission, physicist Isaac Newton presented what came to be known as his third law of motion, which says that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This law applies on Earth as well as in space. It means that if, for example, we push heavily against a wall, the wall pushes back with a force equal and opposite to our push. (To illustrate this force more vividly, imagine pushing against a wall while wearing roller skates.) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In space, when an astronaut applies force to open or close a valve, the valve applies the same amount of force to the astronaut. The difference is that on Earth, gravity and friction provide a solid footing from which to counteract opposing forces. Under the conditions of "weightlessness" that exist in space, astronauts lack this stability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the aftermath of several failed space walks, NASA engineers designed spacecraft differently in order to provide some of the missing stability. They equipped spacecraft with footholds and handholds that allowed space-walking astronauts to anchor themselves to the spacecraft and thus gain some control over the various forces they would experience while doing work. In addition, scientists revised astronaut training methods and had astronauts train underwater. These conditions helped them learn to control their bodies more effectively while carrying out various tasks under conditions of weightlessness.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What are the two points in this interview that you found the most interesting? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compare and contrast a task, such as connecting a data cable, on Earth and in space. What are the challenges in space? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is meant by "weightlessness"? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Find out how scientists and engineers use rockets to attract lightning in this video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;.</annotation>
      <synopsis>The speed and unpredictability with which lightning strikes make these powerful events difficult to study. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; shows how scientists and engineers use high-tech devices, coupled with the tremendous ability of some metals to attract lightning strikes, to study nature's awesome light shows in greater detail than ever before.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Storm clouds can form when humid, sun-warmed air near the ground rises to meet cooler air above. As these distinct air masses churn together, atoms near the top of the cloud become positively charged, while those near the bottom become negatively charged. At the same time, the negative charge at the cloud's bottom repels negative charges on the ground, causing the area directly below the cloud to take on a positive charge. When the bottom of the cloud has accumulated enough of a negative charge, electrons in the cloud move rapidly toward the ground, completing the cloud-ground connection. As the electrons move downward, they collide with atoms and molecules in the air. It's these high-energy collisions that produce the characteristic crackling light we associate with lightning strikes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In this way, lightning strikes aren't any different from other static electricity shocks. Negative charges build up in one area; when they reach high enough levels, electrons jump to a more positively charged area. Such is the case when your feet and body acquire a negative charge from a carpeted floor. When your hand, for example, comes close to an object with a positive charge, like a metal doorknob, electrons jump from your skin to the object -- sometimes, as we all know, painfully so. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Excess electrons, whether on your skin or accumulated near the base of a thundercloud, jump to some substances far more easily than others. Many metals, like the copper wire attached to the rocket in this video segment, conduct electrical charges quite well. This is because the electrons surrounding their atoms move easily from one atom of the material to another. As a result, electrons at the base of the clouds into which the lightning researchers launch their rockets readily follow the path the copper wire provides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The ability of some metals to attract lightning strikes allows scientists and engineers to analyze in great detail this remarkable, yet poorly understood phenomenon. By doing so, they may discover ways to better protect people and buildings from electrical storms, and to perhaps one day harness lightning's tremendous electrical energy as a renewable energy source for humans.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What were the scientists and engineers in the video trying to do? What can the information they're collecting be used for? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What causes electrical potential to build in a cloud? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What occurs before and during a lightning strike between a cloud and the ground? How does this compare to what's happening inside the cloud? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are ideal conditions inside a cloud for a successful rocket launch? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do they know that electricity is moving along the copper wire?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; explains the mysterious force of lightning.</annotation>
      <synopsis>It's an awe-inspiring display of nature: A storm cloud builds, dark and ominous, then releases energy in fiery bolts of lightning and raucous waves of thunder. This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, goes beyond the visual and sonic thrill of lightning strikes to illustrate and describe the physics behind electrical storms.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>If you've ever walked across a carpeted floor, touched a metal doorknob, and received a painful shock, you've experienced the equivalent of being struck by a tiny bolt of lightning. Granted, this sensation is nothing like the shock that would be generated by a 25,000-degree-Celsius lightning strike, but both phenomena are the result of static electricity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As you walk across carpet, your feet disturb some of the atoms that make up its fibers, which dislodges some of the electrons in those atoms. In some cases, the exchange of electrons between atoms in the carpet and atoms in your shoes is equal. Sometimes, though, the carpet's atoms give up their electrons far more readily than the atoms in your shoes do. When this happens, your shoes and the rest of your body gain electrons and become negatively charged, while the carpet becomes positively charged. If your accumulated negative charge becomes high enough and you come into close contact with a conductor -- an object or substance through which electrons move easily -- the excess electrons may jump to that substance and give you a slight shock. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Lightning works in much the same way. Storm clouds can form when humid, warm air near the ground rises to meet cooler air above. As these separate air masses churn together, atoms near the top of the cloud lose electrons and become positively charged, while those near the bottom gain electrons and become negatively charged. At the same time, the negative charge at the cloud's bottom repels negative charges on the ground, causing the area directly below the cloud to take on a positive charge. When the bottom of the cloud has accumulated enough of a negative charge, electrons in the cloud move rapidly toward the ground, completing the cloud-ground connection. As the electrons move downward, they collide with atoms and molecules in the air. It's these high-energy collisions that produce the characteristic crackling light we associate with lightning strikes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Demonstrate the spark effect of static electricity in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2213_lightnin.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Describe Benjamin Franklin's experiment. What did it teach us about lightning? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What causes lightning? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have you ever seen lightning? In which direction did you think it was traveling? What did you learn from the video about the direction in which lightning travels? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Electrical charge builds up in a cloud before we see lightning. Can you think of an example from your everyday life where an electric charge builds up in much the same way? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; follows a team of enthusiasts and scientists who attempt to find a trace of the Loch Ness monster by scouring the lake with sonar.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Because sound waves travel longer distances through liquids than do light waves, measuring devices use sound to determine depth and locate underwater objects. In this video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; sonar's strengths and limitations are on display as a team of enthusiasts and scientists attempt to find a mythical monster.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Taking a cue from bats and dolphins, which use echoes to determine the position, size, and shape of objects and to navigate through their surroundings, humans have developed sonar, a technology that uses sound to "see" underwater, where light travels poorly. (Sonar is short for &lt;em&gt;sound navigation and ranging&lt;/em&gt;.) A sonar device emits a pulse of sound waves in a given direction. A computer then measures the time it takes for the waves to travel outward, bounce off a solid "target" object, and return. Knowing the speed of sound in water (about 1,500 m/sec), a sonar operator calculates the distance of the object or the depth of the water using this formula: distance = 1/2 speed of sound x measured time. ("One-half" is used because the time measured is actually the time it took for sound to travel both out and back.) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A typical sonar image displays various colors, according to the strength of the return signal received by the device. As the sound wave encounters an object or the seafloor itself, its energy is scattered in all directions. Depending on the density, texture, and reflectivity of the object's surface, the amount of energy returned to the device varies. The stronger the return and the greater the number of sound pulses bounced off the object, the clearer the sound image and the more detailed the picture of the object will be. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Though sound can travel farther and faster underwater than through air, it rarely travels straight and true. Just as light waves refract when the matter they travel through changes, sound waves also change speed and direction when they encounter variations in water temperature, pressure, and turbulence. The conditions in Scotland's Loch Ness, where research teams have tried to find evidence of the famed "monster" are particularly challenging. The lake -- whose underwater profile reveals a deep chasm with steep-sloped walls -- also contains pockets of warm and cold water, making readings even more difficult to analyze.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What are some benefits and challenges of using sonar to search Loch Ness? Why are some images difficult to interpret? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the difference between scientific evidence and an eyewitness report? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can scientists tell whether something is solid or made of many little parts by how it reflects sound? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; chronicles Newton's theory of gravity and Einstein's discovery that contradicted it.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, string theorist Brian Greene explains how, for more than 200 years, Isaac Newton's theory of gravity remained unchallenged despite the fact Newton himself had no idea how gravity actually worked. Albert Einstein eventually proved that Newton was mistaken about gravity, at least as it applied to the most massive stellar objects. To illustrate a key difference in their two theories, animations depict a cosmic catastrophe: the destruction of the Sun and the effects on the orbiting planets.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>In the late seventeenth century, Isaac Newton concluded that the orbital motion of the Moon around Earth was caused by the same force that made apples fall from trees. As the Moon orbits, it falls toward Earth. But because it also moves laterally, the Moon actually falls past Earth. Newton realized that the only force that could explain why the Moon didn't just continue along a straight path and fly off into space was an attraction between the two masses: gravitational force. Furthermore, Newton determined that gravity acts on all objects in the universe and that it is mutual between any two objects -- between Earth and the Moon, between the Sun and Earth, or between Earth and an apple. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In reaching his conclusions, Newton had refined the work of earlier astronomers Galileo and Kepler by providing explanations for what they were unable to explain. He formulated equations that described with great accuracy the strength of gravity -- equations that are still valid today. But Newton himself had difficulty explaining one very important thing about gravity: He had no idea how gravitational force worked. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the early twentieth century, Albert Einstein developed his special theory of relativity, which led to new formulations of all of Newton's theories relating to energy, forces, and the relationship between space and time. His conclusions were based largely on a careful analysis of how light waves are observed to behave in different frames of reference moving with respect to one another. Later, Einstein developed a general theory of relativity that explains gravity and the geometry of the universe. In this latter theory, Einstein further developed his understanding of a four-dimensional continuum, in which time and space are not separate but instead bound together. He used this concept of "space-time" to help him explain Newton's incomplete understanding of gravity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Einstein concluded that an object's motion due to gravity could be understood not as a response to a force, but as free and unforced movement in a region of space and time that had been distorted by the presence of a mass. We feel gravity on Earth because Earth's mass causes a curvature of space-time. Our bodies respond to that curvature by accelerating toward Earth's center. What's more, the larger the mass, the greater the curvature. The obvious curved path we see a tossed object take at Earth's surface is not the curvature of space-time Einstein is talking about. His curvature is in a four-dimensional space, with time as the fourth dimension, and is more subtle than that. Still, that more-subtle curvature does explain the path in three-dimensional space we see before us.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What was the first force to be understood scientifically? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What was Newton's embarrassing secret? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does it mean to say that the velocity of light is a kind of "cosmic speed limit"? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe Einstein's thought experiment (the "cosmic catastrophe"). How did it prove that Newton's theory of gravity was wrong? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What would have to be true about the "speed of gravity" for Newton to be right? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Did you know that air has weight? This illustrated essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site explores conditions that affect air density and atmospheric pressure.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Why is it that a climber on one mountaintop may have more difficulty breathing than a second climber at a similar altitude in another part of the world? This illustrated essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site explains how atmospheric pressure relates to the amount of oxygen in the air. It also describes the influence of environmental factors such as altitude and temperature on oxygen levels and atmospheric pressure.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>As gravity pulls the atmosphere towards Earth's surface, the weight of the air creates a force that we call atmospheric pressure. To measure this force at a given location, you simply weigh the air above you with an instrument such as a barometer. Atmospheric pressure isn't the same all over the planet. It varies from place to place according to its relationship with several environmental factors, including geography, altitude, and temperature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Alternating bands of high and low pressure form along Earth's surface from the poles to the equator. In addition, atmospheric pressure changes with altitude. At higher altitudes, there is less air pushing down from above. Thus, atmospheric pressure is lower on a mountaintop than it is at sea level. With less pressure pushing the air molecules closer together, the air is less dense. As a result, the higher you go, the thinner the air feels. Though the concentration of oxygen in the air is the same throughout the troposphere (the layer of the atmosphere in which we all live), there is less total gas per unit of volume in air at the top of a mountain than in air at sea level. This means that each breath of air a mountain climber takes contains fewer oxygen molecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Air temperature is also related to atmospheric pressure. At higher altitudes, the relationship is different than at sea level, where air pressure is higher at colder temperatures because colder air is denser. The reason some climates are cold is because the land and water lose more heat to space than they retain at the surface. Thus, as relatively warmer air rises through the atmosphere, it expands, becoming less dense, but also cooler, with altitude. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Knowing that temperature and pressure drop together with altitude more rapidly in cold climates makes it easier to understand why one sister, standing on Denali (Mount McKinley), will find it more difficult to catch her breath than her twin, standing at a similar altitude on Mount Everest. Although both Everest and Denali are located in areas of relatively low atmospheric pressure, Denali is further from the equator. Thus, air conditions there are typically much colder than on Everest. This sister's physiological altitude, then, is several hundred meters higher than her twin's actual altitude: the atmospheric pressure is lower and the air is thinner.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;How do we know air has weight? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are some of the factors that affect atmospheric pressure? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is air thinner at the poles than at the equator? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This animation from the &lt;em&gt; NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site describes how sonar uses sound waves to "see" underwater.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This animation from the &lt;em&gt; NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site features the two primary types of sonar -- sidescan sonar and fish finders -- and demonstrates how sound waves enable us to "see" underwater, sometimes with great detail.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>A sonar device emits one or more pulses of sound waves, which bounce off any objects they bump into and return to their source. A receiver collects the returning energy and records the time it took for the sound waves to make their round trips. The farther away the object is, the longer it takes the sound waves to return. By analyzing the data from the sound waves, computers are able to create an image of the object and determine the size, shape, and even density of underwater objects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The simplest sonar device, called a fish finder or depth sounder, sends out a single, narrowly focused wave pulse and records the time it takes the wave to return and its strength. This information allows the computer to determine the distance to the target object and the object's relative density. These devices are primarily used to locate fish and to determine sea-floor depth and composition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In more sophisticated devices, which employ sidescan sonar, the instrumentation is encased in a torpedo-shaped "towfish" that is towed behind and below the boat. These devices send out pulses of sound waves that fan out to the sides and below, so that everything in a 180-degree arc is in their field of view. The amount of wave energy returned depends on the density and texture of an object, and the reflectivity of its surface. The more sound pulses that bounce off an object and the stronger their returned energy, the clearer the sound picture. Typically, rough surfaces return strong echoes while smooth surfaces, unless they are perpendicular to the sound wave, return very little if any energy. Thus, objects such as rocks, metal debris, or large fish show up clearly in the side-scan sonar record, whereas gentle slopes produce only light shadows. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Sidescan sonar devices can create very detailed, three-dimensional pictures of objects in the water through computer analysis of the returning sound waves. These devices are used to map features such as hills and valleys on the ocean floor; to locate submarines, mines, and shipwrecks; and to inspect pipelines, cables, and bridge foundations.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;Describe how sidescan sonar works. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is sonar used for? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Imagine sonar-mapping part of the ocean where mountains rise from the ocean floor. Which sonar signal would take longer to be reflected to the receiver, one from the ocean floor or the top of the mountain? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you think it is accurate to say that the use of sonar to map Loch Ness is like bats emitting sound to locate food? How are these two processes the same and how are they different? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Take &lt;em&gt;NOVA's&lt;/em&gt; interactive tour of the electromagnetic spectrum and find out why your eyes are like antennae for a narrow band of electromagnetic radiation.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Technological advances have made wide use of electromagnetic waves. This interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site provides a self-guided tour of the electromagnetic spectrum, including examples of some of the most common uses of different types of waves.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Radiation is all around us, every moment of every day. While this idea may be intimidating at first, there's very little to worry about. Most forms of radiation pose absolutely no health risks. In fact, some forms, like light energy, are essential to life on Earth, while others, including radio waves and microwaves, simply make life more convenient for people who have access to them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Few of us ever consider the similarity of light and radio waves, nor do we think of them in terms of radiation. In fact, visible light and radio waves make up part of a large category of radiation that physicists call electromagnetic waves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Electromagnetic waves and sound or ocean waves have more in common than it might seem at first. Waves of all types are produced by vibration. When a musician plucks a guitar string, for example, its back-and-forth motion produces high- and low-pressure waves in the surrounding air. Similarly, electromagnetic waves are produced by vibrating electric charges that give off tiny packets of energy called photons. But unlike ocean or sound waves, electromagnetic waves transfer energy through electric and magnetic fields, not through matter (water or air). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; All types of electromagnetic waves transfer energy in this way and together constitute what physicists call the electromagnetic spectrum. What distinguishes one wave on the spectrum from another is the amount of energy each wave carries -- specifically, the level of energy in the photons of each. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This energy level determines the wavelength and frequency of a given wave: The more energy each photon carries, the shorter the wavelength and the higher the frequency of the wave. Along the spectrum, electromagnetic waves are categorized according to their wavelengths and frequencies, with radio waves occupying the low-frequency end, gamma waves at the high-frequency end, and visible light in the middle.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What are electromagnetic waves? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is a photon? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Name one manufactured device or natural phenomenon that emits electromagnetic radiation in each of the following wavelengths: radio, microwave, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma ray. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which type(s) of electromagnetic radiation do human bodies emit? Which type(s) can our senses detect? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;List three ways that electromagnetic radiation is used to improve our everyday lives. &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; looks at speed, velocity, and centripetal force on the racetrack.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Racecar teams look to reduce the time it takes their cars to complete a circuit. They focus most of their efforts on improving what's called cornering speed, because it's in the corners, where cars must reduce speed, that precious time is lost. Using a mix of practice lap and actual race footage, this video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, highlights the forces at work on a racecar as it travels around a track.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Speed is the rate at which something moves. Fast-moving objects have high speeds, slow-moving ones have low speeds, and objects with no movement have zero speed. Velocity, on the other hand, is speed in a particular direction. Velocity is what's called a vector quantity, which is any quantity -- velocity, force, acceleration, torque -- that has both magnitude and direction. Racecar teams are most interested in improving average speed around a track. Because all cars can move quickly along the straight sections of a track, racecar designers modify a car so that it performs best especially when cornering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Designers take into account the forces that act upon the car as it moves around the track. Downforce keeps a car stuck to the road by increasing friction and stability, while drag is the air resistance that slows a car. Maximizing downforce and minimizing drag are the primary goals of most design modifications. An airplane wing is shaped so that air pressure under the wing is greater than that above the wing, and lift force is generated. Attaching wings upside-down to the front and rear of a racecar, then, is one way to generate additional downforce. Increasing downforce inevitably results in increased drag, however. Because drag is proportional to the square of the speed a car is moving, drag reduction is crucial. So just as aeronautical engineers design airplane wings to maximize lift-to-drag ratios, racecar designers seek to modify wing attachments to maximize downforce-to-drag ratios. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; According to Newton's law of inertia, an object already in motion will continue to move in a straight line at a constant speed unless acted on by an outside force. Centripetal force is the force that pushes or pulls a car inward so that it moves around the corners. For this force to be applied to the tires by the road, sufficient friction must be generated by tires pushing down on its surface. Race teams make adjustments to front or rear wings to alter the grip of the tires and improve overall balance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Design helicopters that fall as slowly as possible in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2208_fastcars.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What is the difference between speed and velocity? Explain the difference between the speed and velocity of an everyday object such as a yo-yo or a person rollerblading. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is negotiating corners difficult in racecar driving? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the velocity vector of a car turning a corner. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think the wheels on a racecar are much wider than the wheels on ordinary automobiles? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you think the design features of a racecar might result in a fast car?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>What makes an airplane fly? Discover the connection between Newton's third law of motion and flight in this interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>For an airplane to get airborne or climb in flight, the overall downward force of air on its wing surfaces must be less than the upward force. In this interactive activity from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;Web site, learn how wing shape, angle of attack, and speed of the wing through the air each influence how air moves in relation to a wing. Then see how these factors in turn influence a plane's speed, maneuverability, and fuel economy.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>To get an airplane airborne or climbing in flight, its wings must produce more lift than the total weight of the aircraft. One popular explanation for how this happens is based on Bernoulli's principle, which describes the relationship between the velocity and pressure exerted by a fluid in motion. It states that as the velocity of a fluid increases, the pressure exerted by that fluid decreases, and vice versa. For most planes, the wings, viewed in profile, are curved on top and flat on the bottom. As air -- behaving as a fluid -- passes over the wing, it has further to travel and moves faster than the air passing beneath the wing. According to Bernoulli, this creates a difference in pressure that results in a net upward force. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; But that explanation may be incomplete because it doesn't state, for one thing, why air moving above and beneath a wing must meet at the wing's trailing edge. An alternative, perhaps even complementary, explanation calls on Newton's third law of motion: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The focus here is on the tilt of the wing, called its angle of attack, and its influence on airflow. It holds that as a wing is tilted upward, it generates more lift. This is because more air molecules strike the bottom surface of the wing and get deflected downward. This in turn transfers upward momentum to the wing. Thus, if the angle of attack is increased, the plane rises; if it is decreased, the plane descends. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Airfoil&lt;/em&gt; is a term for the cross-section of an airplane wing. While thick airfoils provide lots of lift, they also produce lots of drag, a force that tends to slow the motion of a plane through the air. For this reason, planes with thick airfoils are not well suited for high-speed or long-duration flight. Thin airfoils, by contrast, minimize drag and are both fast and fuel-efficient. Fighter jet wings are almost symmetrical, with the curve of the upper surface nearly identical to the curve of the bottom surface. This results in less lift compared with other wing profiles. To compensate, the plane has to move through the air at high speed to stay aloft.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt;What are some characteristics of airplane wings that provide enough lift to keep a plane in the air? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the "Coanda effect"? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you notice when you try to optimize the lift to drag ratio for any of the airfoils? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What problem did engineers need to solve to create a flying machine? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are some of the questions that an aeronautical engineer needs to consider when selecting or designing the airfoil shape of an aircraft's wings?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn how chemist Percy Julian revolutionized chemistry by synthesizing the alkaloid physostigmine from scratch&amp;mdash;the first total synthesis of a chemical compound.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; uses reenactment footage to show how chemist Percy Julian completed the total synthesis of physostigmine, an alkaloid derived from the Calabar bean that could be used in the treatment of glaucoma. Julian began with very simple substances and, through a series of precise chemical reactions, arrived at the complex final natural product. The video also describes how purification and analysis are used to confirm the pathway, and how melting point can be used to provide evidence that synthesized and natural compounds are chemically the same. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; Since the early 1800s, practitioners of organic chemistry have been fascinated with a group of plant-derived compounds called "alkaloids." Alkaloids contain at least one nitrogen atom among other atoms in a carbon-based ring structure, and occur naturally in vascular plants and some fungi. Notable alkaloids include caffeine, quinine, cocaine, and morphine, all of which have important medicinal qualities, and strychnine, which in excessive or continuous dosages can be poisonous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not much was known at first about how alkaloids form in living organisms. Yet as active agents were isolated, or extracted, from plants, and chemists tried to replicate them in the lab, it was apparent that alkaloids could be very complicated in structure. Morphine, for example, contains 40 atoms, and strychnine 47 &amp;mdash; each one of which has a defined place in relation to the others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Synthesizing, or assembling, organic compounds can be a long and arduous process, involving numerous steps that add, change, or remove atoms from a framework. To synthesize an alkaloid, chemists must first know &amp;mdash; or figure out &amp;mdash; the composition and structure of the natural molecule to be replicated. Then, starting with very small structures that chemists already know how to make, they can begin to assemble these simpler molecules into fragments, called "intermediates," of the desired compound. This may involve lots of trial and error. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To get a compound's atoms to bond in specific ways, chemists draw from several techniques. These include heating the molecule to a high temperature, which gets the atoms vibrating and makes new bonds possible; adding oxygen to the molecule, also known as "oxidation"; taking oxygen out of the molecule, which is called "reduction"; exposing the molecule to pressure; and exposing the molecule to light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To determine whether they had indeed made what they set out to make, chemists in Percy Julian's time compared the temperature at which crystals of the compound melted with the known melting point of the natural compound. Because pure compounds having the same molecular structure melt at the same precise temperature, that melting point is like a chemical signature. Today, chemists use a technique called "spectroscopy" to measure the absorption, emission, or scattering of electromagnetic radiation by molecules. As with melting point, chemical substances produce telltale spectroscopy readings that allow them to be positively identified from a sample. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why was determining the melting point of a substance so important in the story of the synthesis of physostigmine?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What technique did Julian use to determine the melting point of the substance he had synthesized?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Explain how the ratio of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a substance can help you identify an organic substance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why do you think the position of the methyl groups was an important feature of physostigmine?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Can you see any similarities between what Julian did in his synthesis and, say, the baking of a cake? Does it matter what order the steps come in the process?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Using evidence from this video, would you say that scientists cooperate or compete with each other? What role does publication of scientific findings play in the progress of scientific understanding? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn about the molecular structure of steroids. See the intermediate molecules that are part of the pathway for synthesizing cortisone from diosgenin.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This interactive activity from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; shows what happens at the molecular level when the organic steroid cortisone is produced in a laboratory from the "starter" compound diosgenin. Though it may closely resemble a given natural compound in structure, a synthetic precursor is subjected to a series of chemical reactions designed to add, subtract, or otherwise modify its atomic makeup so that it exactly matches the natural compound. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; A class of organic compounds called "steroids" is critical for keeping the body running smoothly. Different steroids perform important roles in the body's reproductive system, boost strength and enhance physical performance, and control the body's ability to combat allergic reactions. Although steroids are normally produced inside the human body, sometimes the quantities are insufficient or their production mechanisms are flawed. In these cases, steroids manufactured outside of the body can be administered to produce desired physiological effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By definition, steroids are substances that have a characteristic chemical structure consisting of chemical rings of connected atoms&amp;mdash;specifically, 17 carbon atoms arranged over four fused rings, three of which are six-sided and one of which is five-sided. This steroid nucleus can be modified in an unlimited number of ways by adding, removing, or replacing atoms. The slightest change, such as the shift of an oxygen atom from one location to another on the molecule, will produce a compound that has different effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chemists in the 1930s discovered that plants had steroids with the same carbon-ring structure as that of animal steroids. Further, chemists learned that they could convert plant steroids into animal steroids. Because isolating steroid compounds from animal sources required lots of raw materials that yielded small amounts of steroids, steroids from plant sources held great promise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To make, or synthesize, steroids from sources outside the body, chemists take known starter compounds&amp;mdash;called precursors&amp;mdash;and shape them into a desired final compound through a series of chemical reactions. The number of steps and types of chemical reactions it takes to transform a precursor into a target compound varies from steroid to steroid. For example, going from diosgenin, a natural steroid compound found in Mexican yams, to the male sex hormone testosterone can be done in eight steps. Making the female sex hormone progesterone requires only five. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To get atoms to bond in specific ways, chemists draw from several techniques. Heating a molecule to a high temperature causes atoms to vibrate, which makes new bonds possible. Oxidation adds oxygen to a molecule, while reduction removes oxygen from it. Exposing the molecule to pressure or light can also produce chemical change. Delivering atoms to precise locations on a molecule can require extreme creativity and persistence. For example, chemists working on converting diosgenin to cortisone searched high and low for a way to attach a single oxygen atom to a carbon atom located at position 11 on the molecule. Only after many failures did they discover that a microorganism used in fermentation could do this repeatedly and without fail, making the conversion possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn how the sex hormone progesterone was first synthesized from a plant model, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.steroids/"&gt;Synthesizing a Steroid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the molecular structure of organic compounds, including steroids and alkaloids, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.carbon/"&gt;Ringed-Carbon Compounds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;How would you describe the chemical structure of a steroid?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Can you think of other kinds of organic molecules that are made up of basic structural patterns (e.g., carbohydrates, fats, proteins, DNA)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What significance might be interpreted from the recurrence of basic structures in different organisms?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Explain why compounds extracted from plants can be useful in the synthesis of compounds intended for human use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>In this interactive activity adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, learn about alkaloids and steroids, both examples of compounds with carbon rings. Short videos with interviews, animations, and photographs are featured.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this interactive activity adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, explore the prevalence of ringed-carbon structures in the natural world, as well as the structural variations that give rise to their unique chemical properties. The natural world is composed of a nearly endless variety of organic compounds. At the foundation of many of these compounds is the carbon ring, the structural component for two of nature's most important families of compounds. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; Much of what we know about the chemical structures of organic compounds was revealed during the early to mid 20th century by a branch of chemistry known as "natural products chemistry." This era of chemical exploration was full of possibility for determined chemists who sought to identify, classify, and synthesize compounds produced naturally by plants and animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chemists found that carbon atoms were at the foundation of all organic compounds. These atoms form strong bonds, called "covalent" bonds, in which they share electrons with other atoms. In fact, the compounds that carbon atoms form owe many of their important characteristics, such as their chemical stability and their wide variety, to these bonds. In many compounds, carbon atoms form long-chain structures. In others, they assemble in ring-shaped structures made up of four, five, or six carbon atoms bonded together. Because any one carbon atom can form as many as four single covalent bonds with other atoms, the variations in shape, size, and composition of carbon compounds is nearly limitless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ringed-carbon compounds were of particular interest to the natural products chemists of the early 20th century. Many of these compounds, which include alkaloids and steroids, were well known even before their chemical structures had been characterized, and their variety and the power of the physiological effects they could have on the human body were inspiring. The alkaloid family, for example, is made up of thousands of different plant compounds, many of which possess therapeutic properties. Naturally occurring steroids are involved in processes as far ranging as reproduction, development, digestion, and response to stress and injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chemists have classified alkaloids and steroids based on their structural similarities. All of these compounds are based around a ringed-carbon structure. Alkaloids are composed of one or more carbon rings, each of which contains a nitrogen atom. The properties of alkaloids vary according to how many rings they contain, how those rings are assembled, and the position of nitrogen atoms within the structure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steroids have even more in common with one another than do alkaloids. All steroids are characterized by what chemists call the "steroid nucleus," a backbone of three six-carbon rings fused to a five-carbon ring. However, small variations in the atoms attached to the steroid nucleus can have profound effects on a steroid's properties. For example, testosterone and estrogen, the principal male and female sex hormones respectively, differ only by the presence or absence of two hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom. This small chemical difference between the two steroids effectively determines whether an individual will take on the secondary sexual characteristics of a male or a female. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the process of synthesizing organic compounds, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.buildasteroid/"&gt;Build a Steroid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.alkaloid/"&gt;Synthesizing an Alkaloid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do you think Professor Robinson calls carbon the "Super Glue" of the chemical world?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why are six-atom carbon rings more stable than three- or four-atom rings?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What makes carbon such a versatile element? What does this versatility have to do with carbon's electron configuration? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; In the cortisone molecule, oxygen is in what chemists call "position 11." How did they derive that number? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, tells the story of chemist Percy Julian's quest to make progesterone from a plant steroid, an important medical advancement of the 1940s.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In this video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, reenactment footage portrays how chemist Percy Julian used careful observation, insight, and determination to search for a process for synthesizing the steroid progesterone in high volume. What appears at first to be a costly laboratory accident reveals to Julian the key to making large quantities of steroids, like progesterone and other important compounds, available to people who need them.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; For thousands of years, people have been harvesting the bounty of the natural world. Plants and animals have, of course, provided people with food, but they have also supplied therapeutic remedies for conditions as far ranging as foot fungus and indigestion, snake bites and malaria. In the early part of the 20th century, chemists began unlocking the secrets of many of these substances. They identified them, determined their chemical structures, classified them, and began exploring how to make, or synthesize, the naturally occurring chemicals in the laboratory. So-called "natural products chemistry" was arguably the most important, and potentially most profitable, branch of chemistry of the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two families of compounds &amp;mdash; alkaloids and steroids &amp;mdash; garnered more attention from early 20th century chemists than any others. Plant compounds called "alkaloids" were notable because of their wide variety and because many were known to have profound physiological and/or psychological effects on humans. Another group of carbon compounds called "steroids" was found to serve important regulatory and developmental functions in many types of organisms, including humans. Steroids, such as testosterone and estrogen, regulated reproduction and development. Other steroids identified at the time were found to be involved in digestion or in the body's response to stress or injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to the vital role steroids play naturally in the body, researchers were discovering that they could be effective in treating medical conditions. The reproductive hormone progesterone helped pregnant women carry their babies to full term, while cortisone provided dramatic relief from painful inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis. However, stocks of these steroids were agonizingly small and prohibitively expensive. These important compounds would have to be synthesized artificially and in large volumes for significant numbers of people to benefit from their therapeutic effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Efforts to isolate human steroids from animal tissues and other raw materials such as urine or bile had proven highly inefficient. However, by this time, chemists knew that plants also produced steroids, and that the structures of these compounds had much in common with animal steroids. Percy Julian and other chemists of the day surmised that plant steroids could likely be chemically transformed into desired animal steroids. In addition, the abundance of plant tissue as compared to animal tissue meant that once they found a way to synthesize steroids, such as progesterone and cortisone from plant steroids, they could do so in volumes sufficient to meet the pressing medical demand for these products. Julian was one of the first and most successful chemists in the effort to increase the supplies of steroids and other important organic compounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about the process of synthesizing organic compounds, check out and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.alkaloid/"&gt;Synthesizing an Alkaloid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Observation is the foundation upon which science is built. What evidence from this video would you use to argue in favor of or against this statement?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Who were the key players in the discovery that compounds important to human health could be synthesized from plant tissues? Was this type of research shared openly? What arguments might scientists make in favor of or against the sharing of scientific findings?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Who do you think should be credited with discovering how to make synthetic steroids such as progesterone available to treat human medical conditions? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What was "new" about Julian's approach to synthesizing steroids and other organic compounds, and why was his method important? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What is the chemical framework shared by the group of chemical compounds called steroids?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, shows the racial violence sparked when the African American chemist Percy Julian and his family moved into an exclusive Chicago suburb in 1950.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;In 1950, Percy Julian and his family moved from Maywood, Illinois, to the nearby, more exclusive neighborhood of Oak Park. This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, uses reenactment footage to document the family's move, the resulting bombings and threats, and the support they received from the Oak Park community. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; In 1935, Percy Julian accepted a research position with the Glidden paint company and moved from Greencastle, Indiana, to Maywood, Illinois. Originally from Alabama, Julian's move reflected America's changing demographics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beginning in 1915, as World War I caused a decrease in European immigration, hundreds of thousands of African Americans migrated north to urban centers in search of better opportunities. By moving, they escaped the Jim Crow laws and the explicit "de jure" (by law) segregation of the South, but the struggle for equality moved with them. In cities like Chicago, more subtle forms of discrimination and "de facto" (in fact) segregation isolated African Americans from the very opportunities they sought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Between the 1920s and the 1960s, Chicago's black population grew, and with the surge in population came an increase in the demand for affordable housing. Congress passed the Housing Act of 1937, but the federal Neighborhood Composition Rule required that public housing populations reflect the surrounding community. As a result, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) segregated African Americans in housing projects on the edge of the city. When the CHA proposed integrated housing plans on two different occasions, racial violence ensued. White city officials, reluctant to have public housing in their own communities, rejected the plans. Ultimately, the majority of the black population was concentrated in an eight-square-mile overcrowded community of housing towers on Chicago's South Side. With limited access to transportation and employment, African Americans were relegated to low-paying jobs and sub-standard housing conditions. They were, in effect, officially segregated once again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Julian was among a minority of African Americans who lived in Maywood, a working class suburb of Chicago. Maywood was predominantly white (91 percent), but had a small black community that dated back to the turn of the century. In 1950, after 15 years in Maywood, the Julians bought a larger house just three miles away in the more exclusive Oak Park neighborhood. Before they could move in, an arsonist fire-bombed the house on Thanksgiving Day. Less than a year later, someone threw dynamite at the house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oak Park was more than 99 percent white. A very small black servant population lived on the far west side of town. (White servants lived in the basement or attic quarters of many Oak Park homes, but it was unheard of to have an African American living in a white person's home at the time.) While Oak Park was a richer neighborhood, some still saw the Julians' move as a threat to the social order. And although some historians believe that the attacks came from people who lived outside of Oak Park, those actions demonstrated that integration in the North was not without disturbing and frightening repercussions. There were, however, many Oak Park residents who supported the Julians and kept watch over their house. Percy Julian lived in Oak Park until he died in 1975. His family still owns the house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about Percy Julian's life, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.soc.civil.tactics.education/"&gt;Getting an Education&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.steroids/"&gt;Synthesizing a Steroid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.alkaloid/"&gt;Synthesizing an Alkaloid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why has housing been such a consistent issue in integration? Why have so many communities hesitated to welcome "strangers?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Mr. Johnson responded to his daughter by putting on a record. Why do you think he did that? What might he have said instead? Do you think he ever addressed her question on the air? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, chronicles the education of leading chemist Percy Julian. Although Julian began his elementary school years in the Deep South under Jim Crow laws, he became one of the few African Americans of his time to earn a Ph.D.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment, adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt;, uses reenactment footage to chronicle the education of Percy Julian, the African American chemist who pioneered the development of synthetic hormones. Julian's early educational years paralleled an educational movement that prepared African Americans for industrial jobs, the growing white supremacist movement, and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. Julian would eventually move north, and finally to Europe to earn his Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt; Percy Lavon Julian was born in 1899 in Montgomery, Alabama, during an era of legalized segregation that had begun years earlier, just as the promise of education for African Americans was taking flight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the Civil War ended, Reconstruction-era legislation granted African Americans unprecedented freedoms. In many southern states, education for African Americans became legal for the first time, and new schools sprouted up across the South. However, the Compromise of 1877 then put an end to Reconstruction and efforts to protect the rights of African Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the 1880s and 1890s, southern states enacted laws designed to dismantle Reconstruction policies and restore political, economic, and social power to white elites. In 1896, the United States Supreme Court ruled in &lt;em&gt;Plessy v. Ferguson&lt;/em&gt; that separate public facilities for blacks and whites were constitutional as long as they were equal, thereby establishing the "separate but equal" doctrine. However, separate facilities for whites and blacks were never equal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Julian started school in the early 1900s, getting an education was difficult for African Americans. There were few black schools, and inadequate state funding left them overcrowded, in disrepair, and with far fewer resources than white schools. It was not uncommon for black students to walk several miles in each direction to school, or for students to bring their own firewood in order to have heat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plight of black schools caught the attention of some northern philanthropists and southern school reform supporters who tried to improve education for African Americans. Some believed that an industrial education could provide a means for training African Americans to work in a changing and growing economy. Among them was former-slave-turned-educator Booker T. Washington, who led Alabama's Tuskegee Institute, a vocational school designed to educate and train freed slaves and their children. Others advocated for full educational rights and a more liberal-arts education for African Americans. These proponents included the black scholar and N.A.A.C.P. founder W.E.B. DuBois. White missionary societies also funded a handful of private black colleges in the South that focused on teacher training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, white resistance to educating African Americans was immense. Because the local agricultural economy depended on and exploited black workers, many whites opposed any formal education for African Americans for fear that they would leave the low-paying agricultural and service jobs. Few public black schools went beyond the eighth grade; in Alabama, there were none. White employers often fired black employees for attending school. White supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan terrorized African Americans by burning schools, randomly beating and murdering teachers and students, and intimidating others from attending. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1916, Julian moved north to pursue his education. He attended high school and DePauw University in Greencastle Indiana, graduating with honors, and went on to Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Some colleges in the North accepted a handful of black students, but the social climate was unwelcoming and the opportunities limited. Ultimately, Julian moved to Europe to earn his Ph.D. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about Percy Julian's life, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.soc.civil.people.oakpark/"&gt;Moving to Oak Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.steroids/"&gt;Synthesizing a Steroid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/pj07.sci.phys.matter.alkaloid/"&gt;Synthesizing an Alkaloid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What obstacles did Julian have to overcome before finding success as a chemist?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why did Julian leave the Montgomery area to further his education?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Is it possible to create "separate but equal" facilities for different races? Explain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What were Percy Julian's "firsts" in the field of science?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Do you think that the 1930's attitude toward African American scientists is a thing of the past?

      <annotation>Deep-sea vents are home to life forms that do not rely on the Sun's energy. They depend instead on energy from volcanoes on the ocean floor. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; hypothesizes that life on Earth may have begun in this extreme environment.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Less than a century ago, people expected the ocean floor to be as featureless as the surface of the water above. However, underwater explorations revealed quite the opposite: towering mid-oceanic ridges and deep ocean trenches. This video segment adapted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; reveals the unexpectedly rich ecosystems researchers found when they looked more closely at the seafloor near mid-ocean ridges.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Seafloor spreading generates new ocean crust, but it may also have created conditions necessary for the beginning of life on Earth. At mid-ocean ridges, molten lava pushes through breaks in the crust during amazing undersea volcanic eruptions. This molten rock quickly cools, and as it does, it contracts, forming long cracks and fissures. Ocean water seeps into these cracks to a depth of several kilometers, where it is heated by magma in Earth's mantle to as much as 350 degrees Celsius (660 degrees Fahrenheit). This superheated water then rises and eventually emerges from hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor as an underwater geyser. When the hot vent water meets cold ocean water, dissolved minerals in the vent water precipitate. In some places, compounds of iron and sulfides form "chimneys" on top of the vents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such an extreme environment seems unlikely to support life, given its high temperature, crushing pressure, and absence of light for photosynthesis. In 1977, however, Alvin, a manned submersible vessel built to withstand extreme pressure, dove to the deep ocean floor where its crew made a surprising discovery -- a vibrant ecosystem surrounding the hydrothermal vents of the mid-ocean ridges. Since that time, more than 300 new species have been identified at various vents around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria called chemoautotrophs serve as the primary producers at the base of the hydrothermal vent food chain. These bacteria are functionally equivalent to plants, which serve as primary producers in terrestrial ecosystems by fixing carbon and creating sugars through the process of photosynthesis. In the absence of sunlight, these deep-sea bacteria must rely on another source of energy. As their name suggests, these chemoautotrophs break the chemical bonds of the mineral compounds found in abundance around hydrothermal vents and use this energy to fix the carbon necessary to sustain life. Other species in this unusual ecosystem, such as tube worms, clams, mussels, crabs, shrimp, and octopuses, use the energy captured by the bacteria to fuel their own activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appearance of bacteria in these extremely hot, high-pressure, and dark environments has caused scientists to speculate that hydrothermal vents or places like them may have been sites of the earliest appearance of life on Earth -- fueled by water, energy from chemical reactions, and a rich supply of resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how life might have originated on Earth, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.earthsys.newland/"&gt;How Did Life Emerge Here?&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/tdc02.sci.life.cell.stetteroxygen/"&gt;Life Before Oxygen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.lifecondtn/"&gt;Caves: Extreme Conditions for Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn about some of the elements scientists think are essential to life, check out &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.water/"&gt;Ingredients for Life: Water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.watcyc.lifeessential/"&gt;Life's Little Essential: Liquid Water&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/ess05.sci.ess.eiu.carbon/"&gt;Ingredients for Life: Carbon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classify symbiotic relationships between individual organisms of different species in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2609_abyss.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Life's Greatest Miracle" explores the developmental process of an embryo beginning just two weeks after fertilization.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Genes direct the development of a growing embryo. But not all genes in a cell are active at any given time. Sometimes a cell's location in the developing embryo determines which genes get turned on and which genes stay inactive. This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Life's Greatest Miracle" explores the developmental process of an embryo beginning just two weeks after fertilization.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>WIn the earliest stages of development it is difficult to tell very much about an embryo, including its sex. Ultrasound scans, performed for medical reasons and for sex determination, are seldom done before the 18th week. In fact, at six or seven weeks, all embryos look almost exactly alike -- and not just on the outside. Inside, there are two gonads, which could become testicles or ovaries. And each embryo has two sets of reproductive tubes, one set in case it's a male, the other for a female. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One way to tell from the very beginning if an embryo is male or female is to look at the chromosomes inside one of its cells. A single pair among the 23 total pairs of chromosomes is responsible for determining sex. An embryo with two X chromosomes will develop into a female. An embryo with one X and one Y chromosome will develop into a male. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In recent years, geneticists have begun to understand what triggers the development of males as opposed to females. There are only about 30 genes on the Y chromosome. One particularly influential gene is called SRY, or sex-determining region Y gene. This gene seems to be active just once in a male's lifetime -- late in the sixth week of embryonic development -- and in only one place -- the gonad. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Despite being active for only a day or two, the SRY gene creates sweeping changes throughout the embryo. According to geneticists who study sex determination, SRY works by attaching itself to other portions of the DNA molecule. In doing so, it distorts the shape of the DNA and sets off a chemical chain reaction. These chemicals turn on other genes, which create scores of proteins and eventually cause the embryo's gonads to become testicles. Not long after, the testicles begin producing the hormone testosterone, which will flow through the embryo throughout development, and cause other changes that ultimately transform it into a male. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the absence of a Y chromosome and its SRY gene, different genes become active. The gonads become ovaries, and without the flood of testosterone, the embryo (a bit less dramatically) becomes female. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Identify the effects of maternal consumption of alcohol at various stages of pregnancy in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2816_miracle.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;.</backgrounder>

      <annotation>Three cloning experts share their opinions in these interviews from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "18 Ways to Make a Baby." Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Enthusiasm and controversy abound where cloning is concerned. So, what to make of it all? These interviews with Dr. Lee Silver, Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch, and Dr. Don Wolf, three prominent cloning experts, show the wide range of opinions that exist in the scientific community on the subject of cloning. From &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "18 Ways to Make a Baby."</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Public interest in cloning began in 1997, when Dolly the sheep was born. Dolly was the first animal ever produced by artificial cloning. Her birth was a major breakthrough in the field of biotechnology -- and the achievement did not go unnoticed by lawmakers. It seems that nearly every month since, advancements have been made in cloning technology, and legislation has been proposed or passed in an attempt to control it. Not surprisingly, these regular announcements continue to fuel the enthusiasm of some and the fears of others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Cloning technology, like many technologies, can be applied in a variety of ways and for a variety of reasons -- some sound and some not so sound. The two most important applications of cloning, and those most often reported in the media, are reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning. In general, reproductive cloning is the one that evokes fear and disgust, while therapeutic cloning elicits a great deal of enthusiasm. So, what is the difference between these two cloning applications? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The goal of therapeutic cloning is to produce cloned embryos as a source of stem cells. These amazing cells have the potential to become any type of cell in your body -- nerve cells, heart cells, liver cells. The important advantage of using cloned embryos over naturally produced embryos is that the tissues produced from the clone's stem cells are perfectly matched to the individual who donated the cell that produced the clone. That's because the cloned embryo contains an exact copy of the DNA of the person who donated the cell. Organs produced in this way are unlikely to be rejected by the recipient's body, a serious problem in organ transplant procedures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Unlike therapeutic cloning, which does not allow the cloned embryo to progress beyond a certain stage, the goal of reproductive cloning (which, in 2002, had not yet been performed with humans) is to create a fully formed individual. However, just like an embryo cloned for therapeutic use, a cloned individual carries the DNA of only one parent. The reasons some people give for wanting to reproductively clone humans range from the desire to avoid passing on diseases for which they are carriers, to wanting to avoid the unknowns associated with sperm banks. Those who oppose the idea often suggest that it is unethical for individuals to cheat mortality by creating carbon copies of themselves and that it's just not "natural." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; While most scientists have little concern over a population of carbon copies, many argue that reproductive cloning is unsafe. Indeed, the technology is so new that it is still overwhelmingly unsuccessful. Its success rate, at best, is one live birth for every 75 attempts -- a rate that some scientists think suggests a deeper problem with the technology, a problem that could adversely affect the long-term health of cloned animals. Only time will tell.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; "There are millions of clones walking on earth." Explain what this statement means. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Besides helping infertile couples, in what other ways might cloning help people? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Explain the differences between reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What are the strengths and weaknesses of each of the scientists' arguments? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Does the word cloning mean something different to a scientist than to a layperson?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Life's Greatest Miracle" Web site explores the debate over the use of embryonic stem cells in scientific research.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Is stem cell research the great hope for people who suffer from debilitating diseases? Or is it an unethical treatment of human life? In this essay from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Life's Greatest Miracle" Web site, Ronald Green, former member of the National Institutes of Health's Human Embryo Research panel, explores the ethical and scientific issues at the heart of the stem cell debate.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The use of embryonic stem cells in medical research is highly controversial and has met with intense public and political ambivalence. A battle has waged over the ethics of using these important cells ever since researchers announced in 1998 that they had removed stem cells from a human embryo and grown the cells in culture. But what exactly are stem cells, and why are they so important? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Generally speaking, stem cells are unspecialized cells that have the potential to develop into many different types of specialized cells and tissues. Most stem cells also have the ability to divide indefinitely and thus provide a never-ending supply of new stem cells. However, stem cells vary both in their potential and in the source from which they are obtained. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One type of stem cell that is generally not recognized in the stem cell debate because it is not harvested as a source of these important cells is the fertilized egg cell, or zygote. A cell at this developmental stage is said to be totipotent, which means that it has the potential to create any type of cell necessary for embryonic development, including placental tissue. In the first few hours after fertilization, the zygote undergoes several cell divisions resulting in a number of totipotent cells. If any one of these cells were to become split off from the rest and implanted in the lining of the uterus, it would develop as a separate embryo. This is how identical twins arise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Approximately four days after fertilization, the rapidly dividing cells create a hollow sphere called a blastocyst, with a small cluster of cells inside called the inner cell mass. While the outer layer develops into the placenta, the inner cell mass will develop into the fetus. Scientists call these stem cells pluripotent, which means that they have the potential to develop into any type of fetal cell, but not the placental cells needed to support a fetus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As development continues, pluripotent stem cells give rise to a wide variety of specialized cells, including multipotent stem cells. Multipotent stem cells are responsible for replenishing specific types of cells throughout a person's life. Even adults have multipotent stem cells -- in their blood and skin, for example. Many researchers think we may have several other types of multipotent stem cells, including nerve stem cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Of all the different types of stem cells available, most scientists consider pluripotent stem cells to be the most promising for medical uses. Because the cells themselves are not capable of developing into a fetus, as totipotent cells are, the ethical dilemma of doing research with them is somewhat diminished. Collecting pluripotent stem cells, however, still requires the killing of several-day-old embryos -- albeit embryos that have already been discarded from fertility clinics -- and so the debate continues. Because of this, many researchers are searching for ways to trigger multipotent cells to, in a sense, regress -- to expand their development potential to a broader range of cell types.</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Dying to Be Thin" Web site describes the nutritional needs of the body and how to meet them.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Why do we eat? How do our bodies use the foods we eat? What organ or system in your body may not be getting enough of what it needs? This interactive feature from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Dying to Be Thin" Web site will fill you in. Just click on a body part or on the name of a nutrient to find out what you need to eat to stay healthy.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Standards of beauty have changed over the years. In the late 1800s, advertisers regularly used models who would be considered overweight by today's standards. Times have changed dramatically. Most Americans are exposed to thousands of media messages every day -- in magazines and newspapers, on television, on outdoor billboards, and over the Internet. These messages promote bodies that are thin and, in some cases, unrealistically proportioned, and they are creating a culture of young people who are obsessed with losing weight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As a result of this obsession, many people have sworn off fat. They avoid eating fat in any form and, instead, obtain most of their calories from carbohydrates, like bread and pasta. For decades, doctors and health experts supported this fat-free nutritional strategy. Fat was the enemy, they said; it was the cause of obesity and heart disease. Carbohydrates were your friends and could be consumed, many thought, in mass quantities with few concerns about health consequences. Recent studies, however, have begun to reveal the flaws in this thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A nutritional plan that shuns fat ignores this food's important role in the body. While fat's main purpose is to store energy, it serves many other functions as well. Either in its whole form or broken down into small molecules, fat does the following: provides insulation, builds membranes, aids digestion, promotes proper nervous system function, regulates hormones, keeps the skin healthy, and aids the chemical communication between cells. And these are just a few of the important things that fat does for us. Still, many people continue on a fat-free path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Somewhat surprisingly, fat-free diets often result in the accumulation of excess body fat. Carbohydrates, including sugars and starchy foods, provide the body's most efficient form of energy. They are broken down quickly into glucose, the sugar that cells need in order to function. This is why energy bars used by athletes are made up primarily of carbohydrates: They are quickly broken down in the stomach, and the resulting sugars are easily transported throughout the body via the bloodstream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; When the body is active at high intensity for long periods of time, carbohydrates must be eaten regularly to provide the cells with the energy they need. Carbohydrates that are consumed when the body is at rest, however, are stored. Relatively small amounts of carbohydrates can be stored in the muscles and the liver as a complex sugar called glycogen. When glycogen stores are full, however, and there is no further demand for sugar, carbohydrates are stored as fat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Although most doctors and nutritionists still recommend that people get the majority of their calories from carbohydrates, they also suggest that many people would benefit from increasing their fat intake. According to most nutritionists, the ratio of carbohydrate, fat, and protein calories should, in fact, be much closer to equal -- at 40, 30, and 30 percent respectively. They stress that exercising and eating moderately from all of the food groups is the proper path to better health.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Could you stay healthy eating three or fewer of the foods shown here? Explain your answer, using information from the site. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why do you think 75 percent of the U.S. population doesn't meet daily recommended dietary needs? What ideas do you have about changing the nutritional habits of people in this country?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Odyssey of Life" Web site explores the often unwitting relationship we share with the billions of organisms that reside in our bodies and in our homes.</annotation>
      <synopsis>The thought of living one's life completely surrounded by bugs and bacteria is not exactly a comforting one. Yet that is what we're doing whether we like it or not. This interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Odyssey of Life" Web site explains how lucky we are to share our space with some pretty creepy crawlies.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>It's enough to make your skin crawl: the thought of living one's life completely surrounded by bugs and bacteria. Some of these organisms live off of the structure of your house, gnawing, digesting, and converting to sawdust what was once a solid structure. Other organisms live on your pets, especially in their furry coats. And, believe it or not, countless organisms -- in fact, billions of creatures -- live on the surface and inside of your body, most of the time without your knowing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; How do all these uninvited guests go unnoticed? Although many of these organisms live out in the open -- on the back of your hand, for instance -- most are simply too small to be seen. No matter how carefully you look, it is impossible to see the dust mites and bacteria that inhabit your skin without the aid of a microscope. As for the larger organisms, including carpenter ants, termites, silverfish, and a host of others, these creatures are notoriously good hiders, staying concealed for most of their lives or coming out only under cover of darkness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; It may be uncomfortable to think of your home and especially your body as habitats for other animals, but that's exactly what they are. These organisms share our space for the same reasons other animals live in a forest ecosystem or a river ecosystem: because they find food and shelter there. Wooden window and door frames provide protection and food for carpenter ants and house borer beetles, just as our skin and digestive system provide the same for mites and bacteria. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Thankfully, most of the creatures that use our homes and bodies for habitats are relatively harmless. In fact, some of these organisms provide a service to us and our environment, much like the role decomposers play in a forest ecosystem. Dust mites, for example, consume the dead skin cells that our bodies slough off at a rate of about 1.5 million per hour. In turn, our discarded cells provide the mites with an energy-rich food, one that might otherwise go unused. Bacteria in our stomachs and intestines also help us to break down food that is difficult to digest and also fight off harmful bacteria that invade our bodies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Of course, knowing the good these organisms do doesn't make them any more welcome. But the next time you feel creeped out by what's crawling on your dog, just remember he could say the same about you.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; How many kinds of creepy crawlies did you see? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How do the creepy crawlies you saw "make a living"? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Do you think you'd ever be able to get rid of them? Why or why not? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Watching plants grow is like watching paint dry: It happens so slowly that the changes are imperceptible from one moment to the next -- and yet the end results are dramatic. This video segment shows just how amazing plant development can be by depicting various phases of the process using time-lapse photography. Footage from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Shape of Things."</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;The growth and development of a plant is one of the most spectacular events in nature. Yet, because it happens so slowly, over the course of days or weeks, it is difficult to observe in real time. This video segment depicts plant growth in time-lapse format, allowing the viewer to observe in just a few seconds some of the most important life stages of a plant, from germination to the formation of a flower, and several phases in between. Footage from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Shape of Things."&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Nearly every plant you see outdoors had its beginnings as a seed. A plant begins to grow when a seed germinates, usually when water causes the embryo inside the seed to swell and break out of the tough outer seed coat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the earliest stages of plant growth, the first root, called the taproot, stretches downward into the soil in search of water and to establish a firm structural foundation for the plant. The root grows both by adding cells and by elongating cells that already exist. Before long, the root forms branches, which improve the plant's support system and its ability to absorb water from the soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after the taproot has become established in the soil, the shoot, or stem, of the seedling begins to stretch upward in search of light. The time-lapse video of this reveals the seedlings' need for light: They bend first one way and then the next in what becomes a repetitive waving motion as they follow the sun's movement throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, all of the energy that the plant requires for growth comes from food stored in the part of the seed called the endosperm. As the stem stretches skyward it carries with it what is left of the food stores in the endosperm. Before long, however, this food will be depleted and the plant will need to create its own food. To do this, the plant must first grow leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaves contain a chemical called chlorophyll -- a pigment that gives green leaves their color and allows plants to collect the sun's energy and use it to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugars and other carbohydrates. This chemical conversion, called photosynthesis, is the process the plant will use to produce energy for the rest of its life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most plants can survive with a combination of these three parts: roots, stems, and leaves. To reproduce (produce their own seeds and, eventually, their own plant offspring), however, most plants must first produce flowers. Flowers produce the pollen and eggs that, when combined with another flower's pollen or eggs, become seeds that can germinate and grow into a new plant.

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Shape of Things" follows the growth of a duck embryo, from a single fertilized egg cell to a complex, hatching duckling.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Shape of Things" charts the development of a duck embryo, from its earliest stages just after fertilization, through cell replication and differentiation, to the final stage, emergence from the protection of the eggshell.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Duck eggs share many traits with other vertebrate eggs. Most importantly, every egg -- whether a microscopic human egg, a frog egg, or a mallard duck egg -- provides the starting point for the development of what will become a complete organism. However, duck eggs, and bird eggs in general, are quite different in form and function from other vertebrate eggs, and these differences dramatically influence the path that development takes for the organism inside. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One of the most striking differences between bird eggs and other vertebrate eggs is the hard shell that covers bird eggs. The shell provides protection, allowing the growing embryo to develop on land outside the mother's body -- an evolutionary strategy that in some ways proves more efficient for the embryo and the mother. The strategy, of course, requires that the egg be entirely self-contained. All of the nutrients the developing embryo needs must be housed within the confines of the shell. Similarly, all gaseous metabolic waste products must be eliminated through the shell wall, and solid and liquid wastes, which accumulate inside the shell, must be stored in a way that will not harm the embryo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Like the eggs of other organisms, a fertilized duck egg cell, or zygote, begins dividing shortly after fertilization, well before the egg is laid. Unlike most other eggs, however, a large portion of a bird egg is made up of yolk, which serves as a food source for the developing embryo. Because the yolk is simply a food source and not part of the embryo, the entire egg does not cleave or divide in half, as most vertebrate zygotes do. Instead, a flat, layered disk of dividing cells, called a gastrula, forms on the surface of the yolk, pulling nutrients from the yolk as needed. A shell of calcium, applied just before the egg is laid, completes the package; it will provide a protected environment in which the growing embryo can develop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; By the time the fertilized egg is laid it already contains thousands of cells. All of the cells in the gastrula have exactly the same genetic makeup. They differ only in their placement within the three layers of the gastrula -- the ectoderm, the mesoderm, or the endoderm. According to developmental biologists, a cell's placement within the gastrula has a lot to do with what that cell will become. The ectoderm, for example, gives rise to the skin and nervous system; cells of the endoderm become the gut and lungs; and the mesoderm becomes the muscle and bones of the embryo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Throughout its 21-day development the embryo's cells will become increasingly specialized. Some cells will form the lining of the intestine; other cells will become neurons in the brain. Every cell, however, will remain part of an integrated whole, a complex combination of many different types of cells working in harmony with one another.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Why do you think cells specialize to form the nervous system and cardiovascular system before forming other organs such as the kidney? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Compare a duck embryo with an adult duck: How do the cells of each get raw materials? How do the cells of each get oxygen? How do the cells of each get rid of carbon dioxide? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What is meant by "raw materials for growth"? Yolk has all the raw materials a duck embryo needs before it hatches. Where does a duckling get the raw materials it needs for growth? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What is being distributed in the system of distribution? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This time-lapse microphotography of developing embryos shows the common ancestry of all vertebrates. Footage from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Odyssey of Life."</annotation>
      <synopsis>Time-lapse color microphotography by Lennart Nilsson shows four embryos inside an egg or mother's womb. With footage from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Odyssey of Life," the segment captures on film the shared ancestry of animals with backbones. Viewers watch as each vertebrate embryo passes through early stages that look very similar. To photograph living embryos, Nilsson uses an endoscope, an instrument doctors use to examine the inside of the body. Fiber-optic technology has allowed him to capture high-resolution images with a lens as small as 0.5 millimeters.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Evolution is the change in organisms over time that gives rise to new species. Development is the process by which a fertilized egg, or embryo, generates the cells, tissues, and organs of a new individual and assembles them into their proper form. Evolution produces the body shapes of the animal kingdom; development produces the body plan of individuals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Biologists have been making connections between these two processes since the 19th century. But in the last decade, these studies have intensified and even spawned a new field of study: evolutionary developmental biology, or, as it's often known, "evo-devo." Using new techniques of biology and genetics, researchers are now investigating development at the molecular level, the genes that regulate and orchestrate the unfolding of a new life. Moreover, the genes not only serve as a construction and operating manual, they also contain a record of the evolutionary history of the organism, because many of the same genes were used by direct ancestors. "Evo-devo'" researchers investigate the ways that evolution has modified embryological processes, and, conversely, how developmental mechanisms have influenced evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Even before Darwin, biologists recognized that species that looked quite different as adults often had close similarities as developing embryos. Many four -- legged animals go through embryonic stages that have similar features -- gill arches, a notochord, segmentation, and paddle-like limb buds -- as they develop into different adults. To Darwin, the embryonic resemblances were strong support for the theory of evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One of Darwin's contemporaries, German biologist Ernst Haeckel, summed up the argument in a famous, pithy statement: "Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny." That is to say, in the process of development, an individual passes through the adult forms of all its ancestors. So, Haeckel proposed, by examining the development of an embryo you could read its entire evolutionary history in the transition from one stage to another. In fact, this isn't strictly true, and the drawings Haeckel made exaggerated the embryonic similarities between species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; But biology now has new tools, from microphotography to molecular biology, with which to examine the process of development in embryos. These new tools reveal that different descendants of a common ancestor do indeed usually go through embryonic stages that resemble each other and their common ancestor. The processes that guide embryonic development are conserved by evolution and reused again and again.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Why do you think all organisms look similar in the early stages of embryonic development? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Think about the four organisms in the video. What are some similarities and differences in how they change? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What surprised you about what you've seen?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This diagram from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Kingdom of the Seahorse" Web site reveals some of the more remarkable traits of this enigmatic creature.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Seahorses are some of the strangest looking creatures in the sea. This diagram from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Kingdom of the Seahorse" Web site reveals some of their more remarkable physical traits.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Child rearing is commonly thought of as "women's work," but there are plenty of exceptions to this notion throughout the animal kingdom. In fact, outside the class of mammals, males share, and in some cases assume sole responsibility for, the care of their young. Males of many species of birds, for example, incubate, brood, and feed their young. And among species of fish, males more often are responsible for guarding the developing eggs than females are. Few males in any animal class, however, rival the reproductive commitment of male seahorses, which protect and nourish their developing offspring inside their bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the animal kingdom, pregnancy is perhaps the greatest commitment a parent can make to its offspring, and it is typically a commitment left to the female. There is probably a simple physiological reason why reproductive roles have evolved this way. Given that eggs are much larger than sperm, and females produce the eggs, it is more efficient for the female to keep the eggs in her body and take on sperm from the male than vice versa. But "vice versa" is exactly the way seahorses breed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Female seahorses deposit their eggs inside of males, and the males subsequently undergo a pregnancy that is not unlike a typical pregnancy for females. Sperm from the male fertilizes the eggs shortly after the female deposits them into the male's brood pouch. The eggs then embed in the wall of the pouch, where they will develop as embryos until the birth of the young seahorses anywhere from 10 days to 6 weeks later, depending on the species. During development, the male provides oxygen and nutrients to the embryos through a capillary network in the pouch. Later, to prepare the young for life after birth, he changes the pouch environment to be more like seawater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Scientists know very little about why seahorses evolved this reproductive strategy. One seahorse scientist, however, suggests that it may have something to do with a simpler strategy that is common to most fish. It is typical for males of a wide variety of fish species to provide all of the parental care. Most often this care comes in the form of guarding a nest. But just as in mammals, protecting developing embryos inside the body, as opposed to casting them off into the world to fend for themselves, dramatically improves the chances that any one offspring will survive. It follows, then, that if pregnancy and live birth were going to evolve in a group of animals, it would likely evolve along previously established gender roles. Thus, the primary caretakers -- males in the case of most fish groups -- would be the ones to evolve the capacity for pregnancy.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Why do you think some animals have evolved the "superdad" strategy? What are the advantages of this strategy? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Do you think seahorses have evolved other behaviors or strategies that defy "traditional" gender roles?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Deep-sea vents are home to strange, luminescent life forms that thrive through chemosynthesis. This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Volcanoes of the Deep" hypothesizes life's beginnings in this extreme environment.</annotation>
      <synopsis>The site where life began on Earth may have been where black smokers stream from hydrothermal vents and chimneys along the sea floor. Excerpted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Volcanoes of the Deep", this video segment reveals strange and luminescent forms of life, such as giant tube worms, spider crabs, and billions of microbes clumped together like a cottony web.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Bacteria found deep in the ocean in the volcanic regions of mid-ocean ridges suggest a possible scenario for the beginning of life on earth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Ocean water seeps into cracks created by sea-floor spreading at the mid-ocean ridges and is heated by magma from inside the earth. Water in these hydrothermal vents reaches temperatures of 375 degrees C and higher and is rich in dissolved minerals. The hot water rises from the vents in geysers and meets cold ocean water, causing minerals to precipitate out of solution as the water cools. In some places compounds of iron and sulfides form "chimneys" on top of the vents. Such an extreme environment seemed unlikely to support life given the conditions of temperature, pressure, and absence of light for photosynthesis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In 1977, &lt;em&gt;Alvin&lt;/em&gt;, one of the first manned submersible vessels that could withstand extreme deep-sea pressures, made dives to the ocean floor during which its crew made a surprising discovery -- an ecosystem surrounding the hydrothermal vents of the mid-ocean ridges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Bacteria called &lt;em&gt;chemoautotrophs&lt;/em&gt; are the producers in the food chain, oxidizing sulfides to provide energy for synthesizing organic compounds. Species of tube worms, clams, mussels, and other organisms are the consumers. These communities cannot rely directly on photosynthesis, because sunlight cannot penetrate such depths. However, the oxygen dissolved in ocean water is produced by photosynthesis near the surface of the ocean. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The appearance of bacteria in these extremely hot, high-pressure, and dark environments has caused scientists to speculate that hydrothermal vents or places like them might be sites of the earliest appearance of life on earth -- fueled by water, energy from chemical reactions, and a rich supply of resources.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; How does all the life you saw in the video survive without sunlight? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What are deep-sea vents? How are they formed? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How do deep-sea vent organisms survive in such extreme conditions? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Choose an organism that intrigues you and describe it. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What is the ultimate food source in the vent community? &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; How do these organisms get food? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Describe the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "A Desert Place" describes the physical characteristics and organisms that define the desert biome.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "A Desert Place" details the behaviors and habitats of some of the Sonoran Desert's creatures, focusing on the adaptations they use to survive in one of the most extreme environments in the world. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The desert biome is characterized by low precipitation, a high rate of evaporation (seven to fifty times as much as precipitation), and a wide daily range in temperature. The dramatic temperature fluctuations are the result of low humidity, which allows up to 90 percent of solar radiation to penetrate the atmosphere and heat the ground during the day, then for this accumulated heat to be released back into the atmosphere at night. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Precipitation in deserts, unlike other biomes, is highly irregular. In the Sonoran Desert, rain usually comes in short, sporadic clusters of rainy days three to fifteen times a year. On average, only one to six of these rainfalls is large enough to stimulate plant growth. Thus, Sonoran plants experience long periods of inactivity broken by periods of rapid growth and reproduction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Plant production, given these extremely limited water resources, depends on the efficiency with which plants can absorb and use available water. Desert plants have evolved a wide variety of structural characteristics that limit the amount of water they lose to the atmosphere -- from dense spines on some cactuses that create shade for the plant underneath, to a waxy coating on the surfaces of leaves. In addition, many desert plants have evolved a functional strategy to limit water loss: They perform the processes of transpiration and photosynthesis separately instead of concurrently as in most plants. They do this by fixing large amounts of CO2 throughout the night, then storing it until daytime when they can use it to photosynthesize carbohydrates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Most desert animals are what ecologists call generalists and opportunists, animals that eat whatever they find, whenever they can find it. Some small desert mammals, however, are seed-eating specialists. One study conducted in the Sonoran Desert showed that while these small herbivores (especially jackrabbits and kangaroo rats) consumed only 2 percent of all the leaves and stems produced by plants in their area in a given year, they ate 87 percent of all seeds produced. Further, the researchers found that the preferences these animals had for some varieties of seeds over others had a pronounced effect on plant populations and species composition.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; What are the climatic conditions in the desert biome? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Where do deserts occur in the world? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What are some examples of desert plants and how are they adapted to their environment? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What are some examples of animals that live in the desert and how are they adapted to their environment?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Sea Behind the Dunes" explores the community of organisms that exists in the New England tidal marsh.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Sea Behind the Dunes" explores the often-overlooked ecosystem of the salt marsh, focusing on the plants that provide both a physical structure for the community and the building blocks for the detrital food chain that exists there.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>On the alluvial plains of North America's eastern seaboard, sheltered by barrier beaches and dunes, exists a unique community: the tidal salt marsh. In the minds of many vacationers, this ecosystem registers as no more than the several acres of waving grass they've driven through en route to the beach. This perception, however, minimizes the ecological importance of the tidal salt marsh, and the nearly unmatched productivity of the plants that grow there. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Tidal salt marshes begin in most cases as mud or sand flats. These flats are first colonized by algae and, if the water is deep enough, by eelgrass. As organic debris and sediments accumulate, the eelgrass is replaced by the quintessential salt marsh plant: &lt;em&gt;Spartina alterniflora,&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Spartina&lt;/em&gt; grass. Standing three to four feet tall and partially submerged in salt water at every high tide, &lt;em&gt;Spartina&lt;/em&gt; grass forms the strip between open sand or mud flat to the front and taller grasses behind -- a strip that feeds surrounding coastal waters and estuaries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The salt marsh is one of the most productive of all ecosystems, rivaling even tropical rain forests in net primary production (the amount of plant biomass produced in a given area per year). The marsh owes its high level of productivity to several factors. First, tides that infiltrate the marsh twice daily bring nutrients in and carry wastes away. Second, the meeting of fresh water (relatively high in nitrogen) and salt water (relatively high in phosphorus) provides a concentrated blend of important nutrients, increasing natural fertility. Third, cyanobacteria (formerly called blue-green algae) in the marsh mud fix and transform nitrogen into a form that plants can easily use. These bacteria, combined with algae, grow rapidly on the nutrients released from decaying &lt;em&gt;Spartina&lt;/em&gt; grass, and are washed into coastal waters and estuaries, where they are consumed by filter feeders that, in turn, are eaten by fish. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Not surprisingly, the most productive tidal salt marshes along the eastern coast of North America are those farthest south. Salt marshes along the coast of Georgia are, on average, more than three times as productive as New England marshes. This owes, in part, to the South's longer growing season. Whereas plant growth in New England marshes ceases in late fall, production continues throughout the winter in the South -- albeit at lower levels than in summer.</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment describes how the &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/em&gt; skeleton known as Lucy could have been fossilized. Footage courtesy of &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "In Search of Human Origins."</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;The remains of the vast majority of organisms that die are eaten by scavengers or decompose beyond recognition before they can be preserved. The conditions under which fossils can successfully form are unusual, and the odds that a fossil will then be exposed at the surface again, and discovered, are smaller still. Footage courtesy of &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "In Search of Human Origins."&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The study of how life evolved would be impossible if not for the history that is told in the fossilized remains going back billions of years. Scientists have described about 250,000 different fossil species, yet that is a small fraction of those that lived in the past. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The oldest fossils are remains of marine organisms that populated the planet's oceans. When they died, the plants and animals were buried by mud, sand, or silt on the sea floor. Land animals and plants usually decomposed or were eaten, and mainly the hard parts -- teeth, bones, shells, or wood -- were preserved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Fossils can be formed in several ways. Buried bone and shell contain tiny air spaces into which water can seep, depositing minerals. Reinforced by these mineral deposits, bone and shell can survive for millions of years. Even if the bone or shell dissolves, the mineral deposits in the shape of the body structure remain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Besides rock, fossils may be found as the result of an organism being entombed in ice, tar (like the famous La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles), or amber, in which ancient insects have been found, wonderfully preserved. Rare but highly informative are fossils created by a sudden event, like a volcanic eruption, that traps living things or, in the famous case in Laetoli, Ethiopia, footprints of human ancestors millions of years old. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Fossil remains come to the attention of scientists when they are exposed at Earth's surface. Erosion, land movements, or excavations often have revealed important fossil finds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Especially rich fossil troves are called Lagerstatten, a German word meaning storehouse. These are localities where conditions were right to preserve even soft-bodied animals, and they allow scientists to read a key portion of life's history. In the famous Burgess Shale in Canada, for example, scientists have found dozens of bizarre, previously unknown animals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Interpretation of fossils poses another set of challenges, and their age can only be estimated by radiometric dating of rocks they were found near or within. Discovery of fossils is only the beginning of mining their secrets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Plot locations of important African finds in the search for early human remains in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2106_origins1.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Discuss the rather restricted set of circumstances under which a large mammal, such as an early hominid, could first become fossilized and then be discovered by researchers. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How might conditions for successful fossilization differ between mammals and plants? Why? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Discuss how different organisms living in different niches might have very different probabilities of being fossilized.&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This &lt;em&gt;Evolution&lt;/em&gt; video segment depicts the landmark hominid fossil finds by Don Johanson and his team in Ethiopia.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In this video segment, Don Johanson describes finding the knee joint in Hadar, Ethiopia, that first indicated a bipedal hominid had lived 3 million years ago. His subsequent expedition led to the discovery of Lucy, a 40 percent complete skeleton of a new species of hominid, now known as &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/em&gt;. The final piece of the puzzle was a skull from the same site, which clearly demonstrated that Lucy's kind were small-brained, although they walked upright.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>What was the crucial change that set us on the path to becoming human? Our big brains, with their capacity for language and making complex tools, set us apart from other animals. Our ability to walk upright, freeing our hands for other purposes, also distinguishes us from other apes. In Darwin's day, and for many decades afterwards, too few fossils had been found to solve the mystery of which came first. To many people, it seemed logical that our earliest ancestors must have been smarter than the average ape. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The first sign that there might be a different road to humanness came in the 1920s, when Raymond Dart described the fossil skull known as the Taung child. The angle at which the child's spine had joined its skull suggested to Dart that it had walked upright, though its brain was not much bigger than that of a chimpanzee. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The question was not fully resolved for many years. In 1973, when Don Johanson found a surprisingly human-looking fossil knee at Hadar in Ethiopia that turned out to be more than 3 million years old, it was the one of the most compelling pieces of evidence yet found that our ancestors first stood up, and did not get smart until much later. The knee was much older than the earliest known stone tools. The following year Johanson's team discovered another fossil that is still a landmark in the story of human origins. "Lucy" -- named for the Beatles song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds," which was played in the camp when the scientists celebrated their discovery -- was the most complete hominid skeleton that had been found up to that time. Although Lucy's skull was incomplete, enough of it remained to show that she had a small, apelike brain, and other skulls of her species found at the same site confirmed it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Some experts argue that Lucy was in some ways more adapted to walking upright than a modern human, whose pelvis has to be a compromise between bipedal locomotion and the ability to give birth to large brained babies. Others point out that her arms were longer than a modern human's, and the bones of her fingers were curved -- features seen in tree-dwelling primates. How much she used her climbing abilities, or whether they were simply evolutionary leftovers from arboreal ancestors, is a matter of debate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Although her hip and knee joints were less specialized for an upright posture than our own, Lucy was clearly capable of walking bipedally, although running like a modern human was probably beyond her. Her funnel shaped ribcage and broad pelvis indicate that she probably had a rather large belly, like a modern ape, reflecting an adaptation to a relatively low-quality, high-bulk diet. The thick waist this gave her would have hindered her flexibility, and her high shoulders and the shape of her torso suggest it would have been difficult for her to swing her arms as we do when running. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Because her skeleton was so complete, Lucy gave us an unprecedented picture of her kind. In 1974, Lucy showed that human ancestors were up and walking around long before the earliest stone tools were made or brains got bigger, and subsequent fossil finds of much earlier bipedal hominids have confirmed that conclusion. Bipedalism, it seems, was the first step towards becoming human.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; One of the oldest debates in the study of human evolution centered around the question of which came first: big brains, or walking upright? Discuss how the discovery of "Lucy" provided evidence for one side of this debate. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Discuss the skills necessary to excavate and assemble bones and bone fragments into complete skeletons. What sort of practice do you imagine would be useful in acquiring these skills? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This &lt;em&gt;Evolution&lt;/em&gt; video segment describes how the famous track fossils known as the Laetoli footprints might have been formed and what they can reveal about the creatures who left them.</annotation>
      <synopsis>The Laetoli footprints were formed and preserved by a chance combination of events -- a volcanic eruption, a rainstorm, and another ashfall. When they were found in 1976, these hominid tracks, at least 3.6 million years old, were some of the oldest evidence then known for upright bipedal walking, a major milestone in human evolution. In this &lt;em&gt;Evolution&lt;/em&gt; video segment, Paleoanthropologist and consultant forensic scientist Owen Lovejoy compares the ancient biped prints with those of modern humans and chimpanzees.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Thank goodness for the irrepressible urge of humans (and other animals) to joke and play around in nearly any situation. Sometimes, it pays big dividends. It certainly did in 1976, when paleoanthropologist Andrew Hill and a colleague were tossing elephant dung at each other in Laetoli, a hominid archeological site in Tanzania. As Hill dived out of the way, he stumbled on what turned out to be one of the wonders of prehistoric finds: a trail of hominid footprints about 3.6 million years old. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The majority of the Laetoli footprint site was excavated in 1978. Until then, the oldest known footprints of human ancestors were tens of thousands of years old. But this trail, some 80 feet long and preserved in cementlike volcanic ash, had been made by some of the first upright-walking hominids. An almost unimaginable sequence of events preserved what paleontologist Ian Tattersall calls a fossil of human behavior -- prehistoric walking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Initially, a nearby volcano called Sadiman erupted a cloud of fine ash, like beach sand, that left a layer on the landscape. Then a light rain fell onto the ash to create something like wet cement -- an ideal material for trapping footprints. Birds and mammals left a great number of prints, but, spectacularly, so did a pair of hominids, one large and one small, trekking across the ash. (Some analysts conclude that it is possible to detect the trail of a third, smaller individual whose tracks overlap the footprints left by one of the others.) A subsequent eruption from Sadiman dropped more ash, sealing the footprints like a laminated driver's license. Finally, erosion over millions of years unveiled the prints for Hill and other researchers in Mary Leakey's group to discover. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The prints, say experts on hominid body structure, are strikingly different from those of a chimpanzee, and in fact are hardly distinguishable from those of modern humans. The only known hominid fossils of that age in that location are those of Lucy and her kind, the small-brained but upright-walking hominids classified as &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/em&gt;. Some analysts have noted that the smaller of the two clearest trails bears telltale signs that suggest whoever left the prints was burdened on one side -- perhaps a female carrying an infant on her hip. While the detailed interpretation of the prints remains a matter of debate, they remain an extraordinary and fascinating fossil find, preserving a moment in prehistoric time.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Describe the unusual series of circumstances that caused the Laetoli footprints to be preserved. Does this combination of events say anything about why such footprints are rare finds? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Discuss why these footprints are so important to paleoanthropologists. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The existence of an arch in the foot is described as an important advantage for a primate that always walks erect on two legs. Discuss and explain this line of reasoning.&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <backgrounder>Every new technology has both benefits and risks. But when new technologies are designed that can reveal personal information, such as an individual's DNA, the benefits and risks must be weighed very carefully. This &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" Web site asks students to find a balance between the benefits and risks, and decide how new genetic technologies should be regulated.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; What do you think about patenting a gene that already exists in the human body? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Should gene technology be used for gene enhancement? Why or why not? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; In the future, many more tests for genetic conditions will be available. Should screening for diseases or defects be allowed when there is no cure or treatment? Why or why not? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Who do you think should have access to the results of genetic testing?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Learn DNA profiling, the technique police use to catch the guilty and free the innocent. From &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Killer's Trail" Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>It's the case of the licked lollipop, and you have to solve it. Fortunately, you have the latest forensic technology on your side: DNA profiling. This interactive feature, part of the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Killer's Trail" Web site, guides you through the process of creating DNA profiles of several criminal suspects and tissue evidence left at the crime scene. Then you'll compare the profiles you've created and, hopefully, find the criminal -- just like forensic investigators do.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;In the last 15 years, DNA has played an increasingly important role in our legal system. Tissue evidence is now routinely collected during criminal investigations in hopes that it will provide genetic clues linking suspected criminals to crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DNA profiles help forensic investigators determine whether two tissue samples -- one from the crime scene and one from a suspect -- came from the same individual. Fortunately, the genetic comparison doesn't require that investigators look at all of the DNA found in the tissue samples. That would take months or even years. Instead, by marking a small number of segments of DNA in one sample and then checking for the presence or absence of those segments in the other sample, investigators can say with some assurance whether the samples are from the same person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How do they do it? Investigators use chemicals to cut the long strands of DNA into much smaller segments. Each segment has a specific length, but all of them share the same repeating sequence of bases (or nucleotides). The chemicals cut the segments at the beginning and at the end of the repeating string of nucleotides, so one segment might be ATCATCATCATCATC, for example, while another might be ATCATC. (The DNA segments used in forensic investigations are, of course, much longer than this.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investigators use a process called gel electrophoresis to separate these repeating segments according to length. Next, they introduce a small set of radioactive "markers" to the sample. These markers are segments of DNA of known length, with bases that complement the code of, and bind to, sample segments of the same length. The sample segment above (ATCATCATCATCATC), for example, would be tagged by a marker with the complementary code TAGTAGTAGTAGTAG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Markers that do not bind to sample segments are then rinsed away, leaving in place only those markers that bound to complementary sample segments. Photographic film, which darkens when exposed to the radioactive markers, identifies the location of all marked sample segments. This film, then, becomes the DNA "fingerprint" that forensic investigators analyze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The final step is a relatively simple matter of lining up the sample profiles side by side and comparing them for the presence or absence of segments with particular lengths. The more segments the two samples have in common, the more likely it is that the samples came from the same person.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Describe the process of DNA fingerprinting. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; In what ways is it like actual fingerprinting and in what ways is it different? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How conclusive is the evidence of DNA fingerprinting? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Where is there possibility for error?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" investigates the promises and concerns surrounding the use of DNA databases.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" explains the technology that makes DNA databases possible, and asks Boston University ethicist George Annas and Stanford University's Mark Schena some of the privacy and ethics questions that will surely arise as use of this technology becomes more widespread.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Increasingly, private biotech firms around the world are storing and analyzing genetic information in vast DNA databases. These companies spend millions of dollars combing the human genome in search of the genetic root of everything from intelligence to sexual orientation to disease. One technology that has dramatically increased the amount of genetic material that can be stored and analyzed in these DNA databases is the gene chip. Just twelve square centimeters in size, these glass slides can hold tens of thousands of tiny DNA samples, all of which can be analyzed by a computer for their genetic makeup. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Currently the kinds of tests that scientists conduct on the samples stored on these chips are little different from the standard genetic tests doctors perform on patients today. Each gene chip, though, holds as many as eighty thousand samples, meaning that DNA from one thousand people could be analyzed for eighty different genetic diseases. Perhaps more importantly, it means that doctors may one day be able to analyze a patient's entire functional genetic record -- all thirty thousand genes -- in a matter of moments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Even though our understanding of genetics is in its relative infancy, scientists have already systematically isolated the causes of many genetic diseases. For instance, researchers have identified more than four thousand diseases that are caused by individual genes. And for many of these conditions, like Huntington disease and cystic fibrosis, scientists have located the actual gene responsible. Gene chip technology allows doctors to screen for all of these genes at once. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Perhaps more importantly, the technology will enable doctors to predict a patient's susceptibility to the countless diseases caused by multiple genes working in concert. Scientists envision a day when computers will run complex algorithms to analyze a patient's predisposition to a condition like retinitis pigmentosa, to which at least twenty genes, each with hundreds of variations, have been linked. The potential for the technology in this realm is virtually endless. The more we know about these complex diseases, the more useful gene chips will ultimately be.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Why could a DNA profile be called a future diary? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What are some of the ethical issues surrounding the creation of DNA databases? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What are some of the implications of creating DNA chips that would allow doctors to screen newborns for many diseases?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Try your hand at reading a segment of genetic code in this interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Relative to the entire genome, genes are mere fragments of genetic code. But for the researchers who study the hundreds to millions of letters that can make up a single gene, they're big fragments. See for yourself in this interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" Web site.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Genetic information is coded in DNA molecules. Every one of our cells (except red blood cells) contains a nucleus, and inside the nucleus are chromosomes. Chromosomes are built from long strands of a molecule called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The twisted ladder-shaped DNA molecule is made of smaller molecules called nucleotides, or bases, that pair up and form the ladder's rungs. Though there are only four different types of nucleotides in a strand of DNA (usually referred to by the first letter of their chemical name -- A, T, C, and G), these molecules are repeated again and again -- three billion times in the human genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genes are specific sequences of DNA that provide the code for building particular proteins, a two-step process. First, DNA is transcribed into a similar molecule called RNA. Then it is translated into a specific type of protein. In many cases, one gene codes for one type of protein. But that's not always the case. Humans, for example, have a low gene count relative to our high level of complexity. Higher animals like humans have evolved greater complexity, not by acquiring more genes, but by using their genes in multiple ways to create a wide variety of different kinds of proteins. About a third of all human genes code for several, sometimes many, different proteins through a process called "alternative splicing," which occurs as RNA is being translated into proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To understand this process, think of a segment of RNA as a compound word: The word &lt;em&gt;alternative&lt;/em&gt;, for example, can be read as a single word, or it can be split to form two new words, &lt;em&gt;alter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt;, that have entirely different meanings. Similarly, RNA can create proteins with its entire length, or with shorter sections that independently create their own proteins. This alternative splicing, in which one section of RNA is active at one time and another section is active at a different time, often corresponds to different stages in the growth of cells, as the protein needs of the cells change.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; What are some of the segments of DNA code that geneticists have identified, and what roles do these segments play? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Where is there evidence for our evolution in our DNA code? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What is the significance of the on-off switch and how might a mutation in that section lead to changes in the anatomy or physiology of an organism?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" explores the implications of genetic testing for breast cancer.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" explores the challenges and questions faced by women who have a strong family history of breast cancer, and who now have the option of being genetically tested for a disease that has no cure.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Gene testing appears on the outside to be an easy first step toward eliminating genetic disease. Unfortunately, for many diseases like breast cancer, the path from test to cure -- or even test to treatment -- is not so straightforward. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Although some breast cancer cases appear to be the result of mutations in one or two suspected genes, greater than 90 percent of cases seem to have no hereditary link. These cases are more likely the result of environmental factors, such as poor diet or exposure to radiation and carcinogenic chemical, and are thus undetectable using genetic screens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For some women, however, genetic testing can provide an important early risk assessment. A family history of the disease dramatically increases a woman's breast cancer risk -- by as much as threefold if a mother or sister has it -- and it is women with just such histories who most often choose to be tested. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To conduct a genetic test for breast cancer, doctors take a small tissue sample from the patient. Using restriction enzymes, they extract and isolate the BRCA1 (breast cancer 1) gene from chromosome 17, and the BRCA2 gene from chromosome 13. The doctors then look for mutations, or misspellings, along each of these strands. Scientists believe it is these misspellings that inhibit the genes' ability to control tissue growth in the breast. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Studies show that the likelihood of the average woman getting breast cancer sometime in her life is about 12 percent. However, if genetic tests show a mutation in either the BRCA1 or the BRCA2 genes, or both, her risk of getting breast cancer can jump to 85 percent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Fortunately, a positive test for a breast cancer gene mutation only suggests a level of probability that the patient will develop breast cancer. It does not mean that she will develop the disease or that she already has it. Unfortunately, a patient's options in light of a positive test are still quite limited, since there are no proven cancer preventatives. These options will undoubtedly expand in the future.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Would you want to be tested for a genetic disease that runs in your family? Would the availability of a cure influence your decision? What if there were treatments that could prolong your life, but not save you from the disease? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Do you think scientists should develop tests for genetic diseases before their cure is available? Why or why not? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Who do you think should have access to the results of genetic testing? Explain.&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Both sexes can use this interactive feature that lets you use DNA information from the Y chromosome to complete a male family tree. From the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Lost Tribes of Israel" Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Except for random mutations, a son inherits an exact copy of his father's Y chromosome, which he inherited from his father. In this interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Lost Tribes of Israel" Web site, your task it to complete a family tree by comparing the DNA sequences of Y chromosomes of known men to the sequences of their relatives.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Sexual reproduction relies on the ability to "mix" the DNA from two parents to produce offspring. For scientists who use DNA to trace ancestry, this mixing poses a challenge by making it difficult to match the DNA of two individuals, even if the individuals are closely related.* As it happens, there are two genetic loopholes that allow scientists to circumvent this limitation. One -- the passing of an unaltered Y chromosome -- occurs with male offspring; the other -- the passing of a mother's mitochondrial DNA -- occurs with all offspring. These loopholes allow scientists to trace both paternal and maternal lineages. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Your DNA is comprised of 23 pairs of chromosomes, or 46 chromosomes in all. Half of these 46 chromosomes you inherited from your mother, and the other half you inherited from your father. If you're a female, all of these chromosomes are mixtures: The ones you inherited from your mother are a mixture of her parents' DNA, and the ones you inherited from your father are a mixture of his parents' DNA. If you're a male, 45 of the chromosomes are mixtures, and one chromosome -- the Y chromosome, which you inherited from your father -- is not a mixture at all. Instead it is a nearly exact copy of your father's Y chromosome, which is, in turn, a nearly exact copy of his father's Y chromosome. (If you're a female, you inherited an X chromosome from your father in place of the Y chromosome.) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The similarity between the father-son Y chromosomes continues from one generation to the next. For males, if you follow your family tree back along the paternal line -- from you, to your dad, to his dad, to his dad's dad, and so on -- you'd find that the DNA of all the Y chromosomes had the same genetic sequences, with the exception of changes caused by random genetic mutations. This is what allows scientists to trace ancestry along a paternal line. The more closely related the family tie of two individuals, the more similar their DNA sequences will be, since these mutations accumulate over the generations. A father and son should have the most similar DNA sequences of all. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The 23 pairs of chromosomes just discussed make up what is called nuclear DNA. To trace ancestry along the maternal line, scientists use another type of DNA: mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Outside the nucleus, but still within the cell, are anywhere from 200 to 2,000 mitochondria. Mitochondria are tiny structures that help the cell in a number of ways, including producing the energy that the cell needs. Every mitochondrion includes an identical loop of DNA about 16,000 base pairs long. By contrast, each cell contains only a single set of nuclear DNA, which is made up of 3,000,000,000 base pairs. Whenever an egg cell is fertilized, nuclear chromosomes from a sperm cell enter the egg and, together with the egg's nuclear DNA, form the DNA for the new individual. The mtDNA from the sperm cell, however, is left behind, outside of the egg cell. This is why only the mother's mtDNA carries on to subsequent generations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Unlike nuclear DNA (with the exception of the Y chromosome), mtDNA is passed on, with no change, from mother to offspring. The father's mtDNA, by contrast, is destined to die off; no trace of its genes will pass on to subsequent generations (unless a woman who inherited the same mtDNA -- his sister, for example -- has children of her own). This is what allows scientists to trace ancestry along a maternal line. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; * with the exception of identical twins, whose DNA does match</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; How do mutations allow scientists to trace paternal ancestry? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why is it easier to trace ancestry on a male's Y chromosome than it is on his X chromosome? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" explores the difficulty of finding cures for genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis, even after the genetic defects that caused the disorders have been identified.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The map of the human genome has provided far more than a simple list of the three billion letters that make up our genetic code. Scientists are now beginning to understand what certain groups of these letters -- our genes -- actually do. They estimate that about thirty thousand genes in all carry the code for every structure and function in the human body. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; An important corollary to understanding proper gene function is that by doing so we gain a better understanding of gene dysfunction. Indeed, scientists have identified the genes responsible for more than two dozen diseases. So far, however, finding the genetic cause of disease has provided little more than the promise of a cure. Fixing broken genes is altogether more difficult. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A decade ago some scientists promised that "gene therapy" would cure a myriad of genetic diseases. Doctors would simply insert normally coded genes in place of malfunctioning ones. The normal genes would override the abnormal genes, produce whichever vital proteins were missing, and the problem would be solved. But several hurdles have stood in the way of what once appeared to be an elegant solution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Many genetic diseases are caused by more than one gene, or are strongly influenced by environmental factors. These diseases are probably too complex to be cured through gene therapy. In an effort to cure diseases that are caused by the dysfunction of a single gene, however, many scientists are continuing to try to perfect the technique. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For gene therapy to have any long-term effect, replacement genes must be incorporated into the DNA of a huge number of a patient's cells. If this is accomplished the genes will be replicated and passed on when cells divide. None of this can happen, though, unless the genes actually find their way into the cells' nuclei. Herein lies the problem. DNA injected into a patient's bloodstream has little or no chance of ending up inside the nucleus of any cell. So how do doctors get genes inside where they can be of some use? The most promising technique uses viruses as DNA delivery vehicles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the late 1980s, geneticists discovered that certain types of viruses, called retroviruses, could be modified to carry replacement genes into the nuclei of cells. These viruses attach whatever genetic material they carry, including the replacement genes, directly to the host's DNA. Because viruses are human pathogens and carry inherent risks, however, progress with gene therapy has been slow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; More often than not, doctors have erred on the side of caution, stripping the viruses of their toxins and their ability to replicate, and injecting only a few thousand into the patient at a time. The effect of such cautious therapy, however, has been marginal because the number of cells receiving replacement DNA in cases like these is quite low. Leaving too much of the virus's own DNA intact or introducing too many viruses into the patient's system, on the other hand, can have deadly consequences.</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" explains the process of finding genes that cause disease.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" travels to Iceland to explore scientist and president of deCODE Genetics Kari Stefansson's use of extensive family trees and genetic analyses to track down the genetic abnormalities that cause disease.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Hunting down the genes that cause disease is a difficult task, even with the human genome now fully decoded. Although humans have many fewer genes than once thought, scientists still estimate there are about thirty thousand genes held within the three billion or so nucleotides in each of our cells. So where and how do researchers begin to look for genes that cause disease? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Long before researchers finished sequencing the genome, some scientists began the painstaking process of isolating the location of genes that cause such rare disorders as Huntington disease and cystic fibrosis. Much of this pioneering work focused on families with well-documented lineages. Researchers traced diseases from one generation to the next, and compared the genomes of living family members in search of differences among them. The more two people are alike -- as are siblings, for instance -- the easier it is to find differences between them. Easier, yes. But not easy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Researchers looking for "disease genes" received a boost in the late-1980s with the discovery of what are called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced "snips"). Scientists believe that these single-letter misspellings in the DNA code are the key to finding the causes of many common diseases, given that many genetic diseases result from such misspellings. The problem is, scientists have identified about 1.4 million SNPs in the human genome. Even with today's advanced computer technology, testing each one of them for a correlation with a common disease is practically impossible. So how do you identify which SNPs cause disease, when there are too many to test? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Fortunately, SNPs travel in pairs, which means that one variation in the genetic code always has a corresponding variation somewhere else along the same strand. These paired variations act like bookends and, combined with the letters between them, form a relatively long segment of DNA. Thus, researchers wanting to find a specific variation can look for the whole segment -- a significantly larger target than the variation itself. And the bigger the segment, the easier it is to locate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Until recently, scientists were unsure how long an average SNP segment might be. Estimates ranged as low as three thousand base pairs long -- still dauntingly tiny considering the genome is three billion bases long. It turns out that the average SNP segment (in northern Europeans) is about sixty thousand letters long. This makes searching for the location of a disease-related SNP about twenty times easier than once thought.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; How can pedigrees (family trees) help identify inherited diseases? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What benefits and concerns are there in combining information about DNA, health records, and family trees into a database? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Find out how DNA profilers analyze bits of tissue to identify human remains. From &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Lost on Everest" Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In 1924, two climbers named Andrew Irvine and George Mallory died atop Mount Everest. Neither of their bodies was ever found, and the cause of their deaths has remained a mystery. The &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Lost on Everest" project seeks to find Irvine and Mallory and identify their remains by DNA profiling. Even after more than seventy-five years, DNA profiles should be possible. This interview with DNA lab technician Gill Rysiecki tells how.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>DNA fingerprinting, also called forensic DNA analysis, is considered by many to be the police investigator's secret weapon, a means of building cases or reanalyzing crimes using tiny bits of cryptic evidence. Indeed, since 1986, when DNA evidence first entered the courtroom, the technique has aided in the prosecution or defense of hundreds of cases, and in the exoneration of dozens of people wrongly convicted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As the acceptance of DNA evidence in the courtroom has grown, so has its importance, for the simple reason that physical evidence linking suspects to crimes is often very sparse. Sometimes the weight of an entire case -- even the life of the individual on trial -- rides on just a few drops of blood or strands of hair. But as the reinvestigation of the 1954 murder of Marilyn Sheppard shows, the quality of evidence can dramatically affect the amount of information that evidence provides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In general, forensic DNA analysts compare the genetic makeup of tissue samples in search of similarities and differences among them. They do this not by comparing all of the DNA contained in each cell, but instead by marking a small number of segments and then checking for the presence or absence of those segments in each sample. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One of the most common techniques, called variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis, isolates DNA segments that all have the same sequence of repeating letters (ATCATCATC, for example). It organizes these repeating segments according to length, marks segments of a few different lengths, and then compares samples based on the presence or absence of same-length segments. Two samples that have as many as ten or twelve of these segments in common have very little chance -- one in several million -- of being from two different people. Because VNTR analysis relies on samples that contain relatively long strands of intact DNA, the technique usually cannot be used to analyze tissues as old as the bloodstains found in the Sheppard house. For decades-old samples, forensic analysts use instead a variety of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, including DQA1. The DQA1 analysis focuses on one tiny segment of the genome. This segment, the DQA locus, holds eight alleles, each of which codes for a different protein, and six of which can be marked and used for forensic analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In a DQA1 analysis, lab technicians compare samples with regard to the presence or absence of these six DQA alleles. However, because the alleles come in a small number of combinations (just forty-two), it's possible that a person could match a sample from a crime scene without being the source of that sample. For this reason, DQA1 is typically used only to rule out suspects, and not implicate them.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Why is DNA testing being used in more and more applications as time goes on? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why might Everest climbers Mallory and Irvine's DNA still be intact after almost 80 years? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; In a paternity, or maternity, test, how much similarity do scientists expect to see between an individual parent and the child? If they could compare both parents' DNA profiles to their child's, what should they see?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" looks at the meaning and significance of the effort to decode the human genome.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life," Eric Lander of MIT's Whitehead Institute explains the effort to decode the human genome -- from motivation to process to importance -- and explains what a genome map can do for science and what it can't -- yet.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>In February of 2001, scientists delivered a complete map of the human genome. In fact, two competing teams of scientists published two all-but-identical genome maps in different journals in the same week. This remarkable news made headlines all over the world because it meant that finally disease researchers would have a full account of every base pair in the human genetic code on which to focus their search for genetic disease. Just as remarkable, though, was the fact that the two teams, one government-led and one privately owned, finished their genome maps a full five years ahead of schedule. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The race to be the first to map the human genome revolutionized the science of genetics. Only a decade ago, scientists using traditional gene sequencing methods mapped just a few hundred base pairs a day. Then automation changed all that. The government-led Human Genome Project (HGP) poured millions of dollars into computers that could read a thousand letters a second. But even this highly advanced technique was conventional compared to the competing team's method. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The private biotech firm Celera changed the rules of gene sequencing. The company's so-called "shotgun" technique allowed Celera to sequence the entire genome in eight months -- a feat that took the HGP several years to achieve. As its name suggests, however, the shotgun technique is less than meticulous. While the HGP's traditional method kept track of where each decoded segment came from, Celera's method required that all of the randomly separated pieces of the genome be painstakingly reassembled. This not-inconsequential step took Celera supercomputers another seven months to achieve. Even so, the total time it took the company to map the genome was faster than anyone could have imagined. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The resulting genome maps have already proven to be far more than a detailed list of the three billion letters that make up our genetic code. Scientists are using them to identify and better understand the tiny functional portion of the genome: our genes.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; What were some of the strange and unexpected things that scientists discovered when they analyzed the human genome? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why do scientists compare the DNA of bananas, worms, fruit flies, and humans? How can this information be helpful? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Scientists have likened the human genome to a parts list. Explain what they mean. Can you think of another analogy?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Although repeatedly exposed to HIV, Steve Crohn's blood cells were never infected. Dr. David Ho investigates in this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Surviving AIDS."</annotation>
      <synopsis>Excerpted from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Surviving AIDS," this video segment showcases the work of Drs. David Ho and Stephen O'Brien. By examining the "outliers" -- in this case, people like Steve Crohn, whose cells repeatedly resisted HIV infection -- Ho and his colleagues found a genetic mutation that prevents the HIV virus from entering the cell. This video segment includes animation of HIV entering a white blood cell through the CD-4 and CCR-5 receptors on the cell's surface. Some individuals have no CCR-5 gene, which means that HIV cannot enter their cells. Scientists are using this new information in the development of an AIDS vaccine.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The year was 1996. Drug companies were rushing to the market with the most effective drugs yet against the dreaded AIDS virus. These protease inhibitors, despite their side effects and high cost, would be the first to ease symptoms dramatically and improve the prognosis for infected patients. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; During that same year, competing scientific groups made a series of discoveries that could open a new chapter in treating -- and preventing -- infection by the lethal organism. For the first time, the treatments would be aimed not at the virus itself, but at a portal through which HIV enters white blood cells and attacks the immune system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Scientists in 1996 identified the portal: It was a large protein called Chemokine Receptor 5, or CCR-5, which is a normal part of the cell produced by a gene having the same name. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; When this gene mutates, it produces the protein incorrectly. In fact, when people inherit two copies of the mutant CCR-5 gene, the cell fails to make the portal protein at all. It simply does not exist, and the cell is like a house with no front door. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The finding was "pretty stunning," said Stephen O'Brien of the National Cancer Institute. He had been searching for years for genetic changes that conferred HIV resistance, and here was a powerful one. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Perhaps best of all, people can get along fine without a functioning CCR-5 gene or protein. That makes CCR-5 an excellent "target" for drugs. A compound that blocks the CCR-5 protein might prevent HIV infection as if a person had naturally inherited the mutation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This discovery has not yet translated into new treatments. A dozen pharmaceutical companies, however, are developing drugs designed to block HIV's entrance into the white blood cell by creating a non-functional CCR-5 receptor. Already, some of them are in clinical trials in HIV patients, perhaps laying the groundwork for the most effective treatments yet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Use this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2603_aids.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt; to create a newspaper supplement about the facts and issues surrounding HIV and AIDS.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; How did Dr. David Ho confirm that Steve Crohn's cells were immune to HIV infection? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How does the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) get inside cells? What kind of cells does HIV infect? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What gene underlies natural immunity to HIV? How does the mutant form of the gene prevent HIV from getting inside cells?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Follow the growth of a carcinoma from initial mutation to widespread metastasis in this feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cancer Warrior" Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;Cancer is not a single disease but rather more than 100 types of disease. Yet all cancer begins with a genetic mutation within a body cell and advances when the cell's descendants mutate further. The following step through from NOVA Online shows the progression of a malignant tumor, ending with metastasis, the colonization of tumors throughout the body. It focuses on the most common type of cancer, a carcinoma, which can originate in the skin, breast, prostate, and other organs.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Cancer is defined as any of a group of diseases in which particular cells in a body cease to respond to normal growth controls. The cells multiply unchecked, crowding out, invading, and destroying other tissues. One of the most important discoveries in cancer research in recent years are the genes that scientists think promote this unrestricted growth, called oncogenes. Experts believe that oncogenes alter receptor molecules located on the surface of cells that are responsible for signaling the cell to divide. These receptors somehow get stuck in the "on" position, sending signals to the cells to replicate at a rate that far exceeds cell loss. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Oncogenes and faulty receptors are certainly critical to the formation of cancerous tumors. Studies show, however, that the blood vessels that feed a growing tumor are just as important. Without a steady supply of oxygen and nutrients, cancerous tissues grow extremely slowly, are unable to spread throughout the body, or die out altogether. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The circulatory system must extend to all living tissues within the body. Therefore, wherever the body is undergoing development, growth, or repair, it must also grow a network of new blood vessels in a process called angiogenesis. Cancerous tissues are no different, although they promote angiogenesis somewhat indirectly. Tumor cells send chemical signals, called activator molecules, to the host's healthy cells. These chemical signals activate genes in the healthy tissue that, in turn, encourage the growth of new blood vessels into and around the cancerous tissue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Medical researchers are now using this knowledge in their search for a cure for cancer. In one study, injections of a protein called endostatin, known to inhibit angiogenesis, greatly reduced the number of cancer cells and the size of tumors in a group of laboratory mice. Whether or not similar drugs can safely prevent the growth and spread of cancer cells in humans has been the focus of dozens of ongoing clinical trials since the late 1990s.

      <annotation>Travel deep into the human body to see exactly where your DNA resides. From the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>While the Human Genome Project has made DNA a household word, the exact location of DNA in the cells of the body remains a mystery to many. In this interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" Web site, take a poetic guided tour of the human body, into a single intestinal cell, the cell's nucleus, its chromosomes, and eventually, its DNA.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Ever since the Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras surmised in 500 B.C. that all hereditary material came from a child's father, great thinkers have pondered the mechanism of heredity. Just how are our traits passed from one generation to the next? Even nineteenth-century English naturalist Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution, wasn't quite sure. He theorized that heredity occurred by means of small particles called pangenes, which were produced in every organ and tissue of the body and flowed freely in the blood. While these notions proved to be false, they did point toward the real explanation. Other scientists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries -- including Gregor Mendel, with his research on pea plants; Thomas Hunt Morgan, who studied fruit flies; and Barbara McClintock, who studied pigmentation in corn kernels -- further advanced the search for the key to heredity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the mid-1950s, James Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin, Maurice Wilkins, and several others finally found the key and unlocked the door. Using X-rays and molecular models, Watson and Crick, with help from their colleagues' research results, determined the shape of the DNA molecule. The twisted, ladder-like structure, which Watson and Crick called a "double helix," revolutionized the study of genetics. Suddenly scientists could begin to explain how the DNA molecule reproduces, or replicates, itself. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; First, the double-stranded DNA molecule "unzips" down the middle. Then, as the two strands separate, new strands form along each original one, with the original strands serving as guides for the formation of the new ones. Nucleotide bases, the building blocks of DNA, move into place to line up with their complements: A's fit with T's and G's fit with C's. In this way, each strand forms a copy of its original partner strand, and, in the end, two exact replicas of the complete DNA molecule are produced. Watson and Crick's discovery was groundbreaking, and it paved the way for all of the major genetic discoveries of the last half century. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Most recently, DNA research has culminated in the successful sequencing of the entire human genome -- all three billion letters that make up our genetic code. This enormous undertaking, called the Human Genome Project, is bringing scientists and doctors closer than ever before to understanding the significance of the structure of DNA. They know, for instance, that tiny mutations in the sequence of bases -- a spelling difference of even a single letter of DNA code -- can cause debilitating disease. Armed with this information, researchers are discovering that it is possible not only to understand the causes of genetic diseases, but also to do something to cure them.</backgrounder>

      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;All cell division is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same. Cells can divide by mitosis, so each daughter cell retains a full set of chromosomes, or by meiosis, which halves the chromosomes and produces sperm and eggs. Making a baby with the correct number of chromosomes is therefore crucially dependent on meiosis. This Flash feature from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "18 Ways to Make a Baby" provides a step-by-step, side-by-side comparison of meiosis and mitosis.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;From a human perspective, it appears nature has come up with some ingenious ways to overcome the obstacles it has faced. Take the evolution of sex, for instance. Nature took a system by which parent cells reproduced simply by dividing (asexual reproduction), and altered it to allow two parent cells to combine to create offspring (sexual reproduction). For the latter process to work, however, the parent cells had to start with only half the amount of DNA, so that when they combined, the resulting daughter cell would contain one complete set: half from one parent and half from the other. This process is called meiosis. What's the difference between meiosis and mitosis? Mitosis is a stage in the cell cycle, the sequence of events cells undergo as they grow and divide. During mitosis, the nucleus of a cell divides to create two new nuclei, each containing an identical copy of DNA. (Cytokinesis is the next stage during which the cell actually pinches in two.) Almost all of the DNA duplication in your body is carried out through mitosis. Meiosis, in contrast, is the process by which sex cells (sperm and eggs) are created. While the other cells in your body contain 46 chromosomes: 23 from your father and 23 from your mother, your egg (or sperm) cells contain only half that number -- a total of 23 chromosomes. When an egg and sperm unite to make a fertilized egg, the chromosomes add up to 46. How exactly does meiosis mix and halve chromosomes? Find out through this feature, which provides a step-by-step, side-by-side comparison of meiosis and mitosis.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compare and contrast the processes of mitosis and meiosis. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does meiosis account for the genetic variability of siblings?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" looks at the potential created by understanding the human genome.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" explores the exciting, sometimes scary, possibilities that have been created from the successful decoding of the human genome. In the video segment, host Robert Krulwich and geneticist Eric Lander of Massachusetts Institute of Technology discuss what may one day be possible, while at the same time emphasizing how little we still know.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Techniques of genetic modification allow scientists to change an organism's genetic code -- creating a plant or animal that never before existed. Not surprisingly, this idea frightens many people. They fear innumerable unforeseen possibilities, including creatures or diseases against which we have no defense. Many scientists strongly acknowledge these fears, saying that despite all we know about genetics, there is still much that remains shrouded in mystery. So what is possible, and what will likely never be? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; By introducing genes into newly fertilized eggs, geneticists can give plants and animals traits that would never be possible within their species, genus, or even scientific kingdom. Indeed, scientists have placed insect genes in the cells of mammals, and grown plants that carry animal genes. Just a few examples are potatoes that deliver a virus-fighting vaccine to those who eat them, beets that produce a low-calorie sweetener in place of sugar, mice that make human growth hormone in their bladders, and goats that produce as a by-product of their milk a protein that's helpful to hemophiliacs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The technique of producing these so-called "transgenics" owes to the fact that all organisms -- animals, plants, bacteria -- have a huge number of genes in common. And we now know where many of these genes are located and what they do. This means that scientists can find, for instance, a portion of an animal's genome that is instrumental in the formation of a certain body part, and insert genes that will change that body part in sometimes-dramatic ways. This is not to say, however, that the process is simple, or that the possibilities are limitless. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For now, and likely forever, the idea of swapping whole body parts across species exists only in the realm of science fiction. There is no master gene for wings, for example, and so no simple genetic swap that would cause a frog to sprout dragonfly wings instead of large legs for jumping. Complete structures like limbs and hearts and eyes are extremely complex, relying on countless genes and proteins to create their structures and drive their functions. For the time being, introducing just one gene that codes for a single protein is difficult enough.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; What are some possible future uses of genetic technology? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; If future technology allows it, do you think parents should be able to choose specific characteristics for their babies? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Do the benefits of new genetic tools outweigh the risks?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <synopsis>Which dictates our existence -- our genetic makeup or the environment we grow up in? Kevin Davies offers an update on this long-standing debate.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The Nature versus Nurture debate is a long-standing one among biologists and psychologists. Does Nature (our genes) determine what we become, or does Nurture (our environment)? The answer is obviously both, but as this &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" Web site explains, recent findings have placed a greater emphasis on Nurture.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; According to Dr. Davies, what are the benefits and drawbacks of our recently developed ability to decode the human genome? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Which of his points do you find most compelling? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What legislation might you propose to promote or control the application of new knowledge of the human genome?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" describes the genetics of Tay-Sachs disease.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" illustrates the power of the genetic code. The video tells the stories of two couples following the discovery that their child has Tay-Sachs disease, an incurable disorder caused by the misspelling of just one letter out of three billion in the entire human genome.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Tay-Sachs disease is a fatal genetic disorder that causes progressive destruction of the brain in young children. The majority of children with Tay-Sachs appear to develop normally for the first six months of life before rapidly regressing. They develop severe seizures usually by the age of two. By three, most have become completely incapacitated. Children with Tay-Sachs usually die before they reach age five. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The disease is caused by the absence of a vital enzyme called hexosaminidase A, or Hex-A. This enzyme allows the body to break down a fat called GM2 ganglioside. Children with Tay-Sachs do not produce Hex-A, and thus have no way to metabolize GM2 ganglioside. The fat builds up in the body, especially in the brain and other nervous tissue. This buildup of fat creates swelling and ultimately an increase in cranial pressure that causes nerve cells to die. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Each of us has two genes responsible for coding for the enzyme Hex-A. We receive one of these genes from our mother and one from our father. Most of us have two normal, or active, Hex-A genes. Some people have one active and one inactive gene. Fortunately, that's all that is required to be free of Tay-Sachs. Tay-Sachs is a recessive disorder, which means that the presence of one "good," or active, Hex-A gene outweighs the presence of an inactive Hex-A gene. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Inactivity in a Hex-A gene is usually caused by a mutation on the gene itself, a mutation that can be passed from one generation to the next. Of the more than fifty mutations that have been identified, one of the most prevalent results from a single base difference. This means just one nucleotide on that gene is different from the normal sequence of an active Hex-A gene. This tiny difference, if a child were to inherit two of the same type, is enough to cause Tay-Sachs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Unfortunately, even though the Hex-A gene has been identified, there is still no cure for Tay-Sachs, no way to replace bad genes with good ones. All that the identification of the gene can provide so far is a means to test people who think they might be carriers. Since the first Tay-Sachs screen was developed, millions of such people -- especially those in high-risk ethnic groups, like Eastern European Jews, and those who have a family history of Tay-Sachs -- have been tested for the Hex-A mutation.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; How can a mutation in a single DNA base affect the production of normal proteins? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How are mutations passed on to offspring? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What does it mean to be a carrier of a disease? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What is the pattern of inheritance for diseases carried by recessive genes? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What is Tay Sachs?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "18 Ways to Make a Baby" describes a technique used to determine the health of a developing embryo.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "18 Ways to Make a Baby" follows a couple and their doctor's use of a fertility technique called preimplantation genetic diagnosis, which is used to identify healthy embryos during the process of in vitro fertilization.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>For some adults who have a genetic disease or suspect they carry genes that might cause a genetic disorder, the risk of passing that disease on to their children is simply too great. A woman with Huntington disease, for example, has a 50 percent chance of passing her debilitating and ultimately lethal neurological disorder on to her child. A man who carries the gene for cystic fibrosis has a 25 percent chance of fathering a child with the disease if his female partner is also a carrier. Many such people sacrifice their desire to bear children in order to stop a family disease in its tracks. But thanks to a technique called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, some disease sufferers and carriers are finding it is possible to have children, with far less worry about genetic consequences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Despite its short history -- the technique has been in use for only a few years -- pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) holds once-unimaginable potential for thousands of people with a strong family history of genetic disease. The technique is similar to other forms of genetic testing, but instead of focusing on adults, it allows doctors to look for gene and chromosome abnormalities in developing embryos so tiny they can only be seen with a microscope. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; PGD capitalizes on the techniques of in vitro fertilization (IVF) developed in the late-1970s as a solution to infertility. In an IVF procedure, a woman's ovaries are stimulated with fertility drugs to produce many more eggs than they would normally in one cycle. These eggs are harvested and placed in a petri dish, where they are then fertilized with sperm. Doctors select one or more of the embryos that subsequently develop and, usually on the third day, place them back in the woman's uterus where one will hopefully "implant" and continue to develop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; With PGD, the standard IVF process is interrupted. On the third day, before implanting the embryo (a mass of just eight to ten cells at this point), geneticists extract one of the cells and analyze its DNA. Depending on the disease or diseases the geneticists are screening for, they may look for chromosome abnormalities, gene abnormalities, or both. If, for instance, their main concern is Down's syndrome, a disease caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 21, they may look only for that chromosome. If they are concerned about Huntington disease, caused by a single gene on chromosome 4, they look specifically for that gene. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; There is tremendous potential for PGD, thanks to our newfound knowledge of the human genome. For the moment, however, the technique is limited in its usefulness. It remains prohibitively expensive and/or unavailable to most people. There may be only a few thousand performed worldwide this year. More importantly, experts say, PGD cannot yet provide a reliable diagnosis of an embryo's health, because doctors perform the analysis on just one or two of each embryo's cells. Chromosomal abnormalities can remain hidden in such a small sample. And, while a more developed embryo would provide doctors with more cells to analyze, embryos that are more than four or five days old do not easily implant in the uterus. Researchers are working now to address this problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Consider in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2811_baby.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt; some of the ethical, legal, and social issues related to allowing a post-menopausal woman to give birth..</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This narrated animation schematically shows the process of protein synthesis. Adapted from Interactive &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Secret of Life."</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt; This narrated animation illustrates the process of protein synthesis, starting with chromosomal DNA inside the cell's nucleus. A gene is transcribed into messenger RNA, which leaves the nucleus and binds to a ribosome in the cytoplasm. There, transfer RNAs attach and build a polypeptide chain that will fold into a functional protein. Adapted from Interactive &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Secret of Life."&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;How can millions of different and complex structures be built using only a few simple building blocks? Just ask your DNA. DNA (short for &lt;strong&gt;d&lt;/strong&gt;eoxyribo&lt;strong&gt;n&lt;/strong&gt;ucleic &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;cid) spells out the genetic codes of millions of species, using just four molecules: adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C). These molecules are called nucleotide bases. Different sequences of nucleotide bases are what define each species. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But DNA sequences are only templates for building and maintaining organisms. Alone they can't do anything. A living cell must provide the energy and "machinery" to extract and carry out DNA's instructions. Inside the living cell, DNA directs cellular activities -- growth, division, movement, maintenance, and even death -- in a surprisingly simple way. It just tells the cell to build the right proteins at the right times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DNA contains discrete sequences, called genes, each of which holds the code for one or more proteins. But the DNA exists in a unique form that ensures that the codes are used only at the appropriate times. Two sugar-phosphate backbones, connected by "rungs" of nucleotide bases, are wound around each other to form a double helix. They are bound together by chemical bonds between the strands: adenines pair up with thymines, and cytosines with guanines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When a cell needs to make a particular protein, an activation signal stimulates an enzyme (DNA helicase) to unwind the DNA in the region of the appropriate gene. As the two strands of DNA separate, the so-called "coding strand" becomes a template for building a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). RNA is similar to DNA, except that it is single-stranded and contains uracil (U) in place of DNA's thymine. An enzyme called RNA polymerase "transcribes" DNA into mRNA by piecing together complementary mRNA bases along the DNA template. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once the DNA code has been transcribed into mRNA, it moves out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. There, two kinds of molecules interact with the mRNA to "translate" it into a protein: ribosomes and transfer RNA (tRNA). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Each transfer RNA contains a triplet of nucleotide bases (CGG, for example) and the corresponding amino acid (for example, CGG goes with alanine). The tRNAs need to link up in an order that complements the mRNA code, but tRNAs can't bind to mRNA directly; they need ribosomes to pair them up. Ribosomes are large RNA-protein complexes that can hold on to an mRNA strand plus two tRNAs at a time. As the ribosome ratchets along the mRNA, it brings together tRNAs, whose amino acids bind. This growing string of amino acid building blocks becomes (finally!) the protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While this ends the process of protein synthesis, it's only the beginning for the protein, which will pass through a series of organelles that may chop it apart and/or add sugars to it before finally sending it on to its final destination. Proteins may be used inside the cell, sent out to its surface, or excreted from the cell entirely.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is the information about making different kinds of proteins passed from parents to children? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What building block molecules make up proteins? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What are the steps in the process of protein synthesis from DNA to polypeptide chain? Incorporate the following terms into your discussion: DNA, bases, transcription, mRNA, translation, codons, anticodons, ribosomes, polypeptides, amino acids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>How do researchers read the tiny As, Gs, Ts, and Cs that comprise DNA? This step-by-step explanation shows you. From &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life."</annotation>
      <synopsis>The Human Genome Project announced in the spring of 2001 that they had sequenced the entire human genome of three billion base pairs. How did they do it? Starting with intact chromosomes, this step-by-step activity shows how the DNA is cut into fragments, cloned, and replicated, and, finally, how the sequence is detected and assembled. From the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" Web site.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>A single DNA nucleotide, the base unit of the human genome, is made up of only 30 atoms (plus or minus a few, depending on the base), making it much too small to be identified by even the most powerful electron microscope. So how, then, do researchers determine the sequence of A's, G's, C's, and T's that comprise the genome? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The answer is that they've had to develop a new process, what Bruce Birren of MIT's Whitehead Institute calls a "biochemical magnifying glass." But this magnifier doesn't enlarge the view of DNA bases. Rather, it makes billions of identical copies of a small sequence of DNA -- enough copies to allow a machine to detect marked bases within the DNA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; At first glance, the method described in this feature may seem a bit complex, even roundabout. But then sequencing the human genome is not as easy as A-G-C. The concepts involved, however, are easy to grasp. "Sequence for Yourself" should give you a good idea of the process.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; In your own words, describe the basic steps in sequencing human DNA. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What past discoveries about genetics did scientists make that now allow them to sequence human DNA? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What technologies and inventions allowed scientists to sequence human DNA?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" looks at one of the key players in the race to decode the human genome.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" takes a closer look at the life and motivations of J. Craig Venter, the president of Celera -- the company that many say won the race to decode the human genome -- and the innovator of a revolutionary gene-sequencing technique.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>In June of 2000, two teams of scientists announced jointly that they had each finished sequencing the human genome. This remarkable news made headlines all over the world because it meant that finally disease researchers would have a map with which to begin seeking cures for all kinds of genetic diseases. Almost as amazing was the fact that the two teams, one government-led and one privately owned, and pushed by the fierce competition between them, completed the sequencing five years ahead of schedule. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Their speedy progress was made possible, in part, by simply throwing more resources at the task, using more equipment, more people, and increased automation. At least that was the strategy taken by the government-led Human Genome Project. The private biotech firm Celera, however, changed the rules of the sequencing race -- and in doing so, revolutionized the science of genomics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Celera boldly called their gene-sequencing method the "shotgun" technique. Here's how it worked: To decode the genome, each of the company's three hundred sequencers chopped up long strands of DNA into tiny segments and replicated them thousands of times inside bacteria. They stained the segments with fluorescent dyes so that each of the four types of nucleotides gave off a different color. Then they identified every nucleotide in a given sample. Since the process was automated, it could operate continuously twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. But while the decoding process was efficient, it was also nearly completely random. That's because as the sequencers cut up and decoded segments of DNA, they did not keep track of the original location of each piece within the larger segment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In fact, the news that fell below the June 2000 headlines was that Celera researchers hadn't really finished the sequencing process, at least not completely or accurately. At that time, Celera's machines had decoded the genome -- they had read every letter -- but those letters were not yet plotted on anything that resembled a genome map. Celera's method required another not-inconsequential step. And no one knew for sure how long this step might take. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A Celera supercomputer used a mathematical algorithm to reassemble the decoded genome. This machine compared thousands of segments of DNA at a a time in search of overlap among them. Overlap exists because the sequencers cut strands of DNA randomly, producing segments of different lengths and with different beginning and ending points. By comparing the codes of countless segments, Celera's computer painstakingly reassembled them like so many tiny pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. In February of 2001, eight months after the first announcement, Celera published the complete map of the human genome. The Human Genome Project, which began more than five years before Celera joined the sequencing race, published its human genome map in another journal the same week.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; What is the process for sequencing the human genome? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How has the way scientists read the genetic code changed in recent years? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why is the map of the human genome considered only the beginning of the Human Genome Project?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Killer's Trail" investigates the potential for DNA evidence to solve murder cases, even those from the distant past.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Killer's Trail" follows a team of experts as they investigate the forensic evidence from the 1954 murder of Marilyn Sheppard, one of the most famous unsolved crimes in U.S. history.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>DNA fingerprinting, also called forensic DNA analysis, is considered by many to be the police investigator's secret weapon, a means of building cases or reanalyzing crimes using tiny bits of cryptic evidence. Indeed, since 1986, when DNA evidence first entered the courtroom, the technique has aided in the prosecution or defense of hundreds of cases, and in the exoneration of dozens of people wrongly convicted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As the acceptance of DNA evidence in the courtroom has grown, so has its importance, for the simple reason that physical evidence linking suspects to crimes is often very sparse. Sometimes the weight of an entire case -- even the life of the individual on trial -- rides on just a few drops of blood or strands of hair. But as the reinvestigation of the 1954 murder of Marilyn Sheppard shows, the quality of evidence can dramatically affect the amount of information that evidence provides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In general, forensic DNA analysts compare the genetic makeup of tissue samples in search of similarities and differences among them. They do this not by comparing all of the DNA contained in each cell, but instead by marking a small number of segments and then checking for the presence or absence of those segments in each sample. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One of the most common techniques, called variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis, isolates DNA segments that all have the same sequence of repeating letters (ATCATCATC, for example). It organizes these repeating segments according to length, marks segments of a few different lengths, and then compares samples based on the presence or absence of same-length segments. Two samples that have as many as ten or twelve of these segments in common have very little chance -- one in several million -- of being from two different people. Because VNTR analysis relies on samples that contain relatively long strands of intact DNA, the technique usually cannot be used to analyze tissues as old as the bloodstains found in the Sheppard house. For decades-old samples, forensic analysts use instead a variety of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, including DQA1. The DQA1 analysis focuses on one tiny segment of the genome. This segment, the DQA locus, holds eight alleles, each of which codes for a different protein, and six of which can be marked and used for forensic analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In a DQA1 analysis, lab technicians compare samples with regard to the presence or absence of these six DQA alleles. However, because the alleles come in a small number of combinations (just forty-two), it's possible that a person could match a sample from a crime scene without being the source of that sample. For this reason, DQA1 is typically used only to rule out suspects, and not implicate them.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; How was DNA evidence used to prove that Dr. Sam Sheppard did not murder his wife? Why wasn't this evidence used when the case first went to court? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why do you think the DQA1 test was chosen for DNA analysis in this case, instead of another, more powerful genetic test? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; If the blood trail left at the murder scene wasn't Marilyn's or Sam's, whose blood might it have been? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; If you were a juror on this trial, would you be convinced by the DNA evidence?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" explores the genetic similarities and differences among organisms.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" geneticist Eric Lander of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology explains the genetic similarities and differences among organisms, and stresses that having a list of genetic components -- as we have with the map of the human genome -- is a long way from understanding how all those parts work together.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The announcement in February 2001 that scientists had completed a map of the human genome included some surprising information -- information that made some people uncomfortable. The announcement revealed that humans have only thirty thousand genes, many fewer than the one hundred thousand that scientists predicted, and just twice as many genes as fruit flies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For those who have long considered our species to be evolutionarily advanced, it seemed inconceivable that our parts list could be only slightly longer than -- not to mention identical in many ways to -- that of a lowly invertebrate. Fortunately, the lack of variability between us and them, with regard to the code of our genes, belies a more complex story. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Genes are units of DNA that provide the instructions required to build proteins. They do this in a two-step process in which DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into a specific type of protein. In many cases, one gene codes for one type of protein. But that's not always the case, as evidenced by our low gene count relative to our high level of complexity. Higher animals have evolved greater complexity, not by acquiring more genes, but by using their genes differently. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As it turns out, about a third of all human genes code for several, sometimes many, different proteins. They do this through a process called "alternative splicing" in the second half of the protein-building process, when RNA is being translated into proteins. RNA is similar to a compound word: &lt;em&gt;alternative,&lt;/em&gt; for example, can be read as one word, or it can be split to form two new words -- &lt;em&gt;alter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; -- that have entirely different meanings. Likewise, RNA can create proteins with its entire length, or with shorter sections that independently create their own proteins. This alternative splicing, in which one section of RNA is active at one time and another section is active at a different time, often corresponds to different stages in the growth of cells, as the protein needs of the cells change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Learn how to extract human DNA from cheek cells in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2809_genome.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Whose genes are being sequenced in the two human genome projects? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Are these genes representative of the human species? Why or why not? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What is the percentage of genetic difference between any two humans? What does this tell us? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What does the similarity of basic functions between different organisms indicate?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life" examines the social and ethical implications of genome research.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cracking the Code of Life," geneticist Eric Lander from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology explains how the patenting process, once used by inventors to protect their inventions, is now being used by biotech firms to claim pieces of the human genome.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Long before the human genome was fully sequenced, biotech companies were inundating the United States Patent and Trademark Office with applications for patents on bits and pieces of human genetic code. The companies have sought to control rights to specific genes or, sometimes, smaller segments of DNA with as-yet unknown functions. Such rights would limit the ability of other companies or researchers to profit from or even do research on those pieces of the genome. For now, tens of thousands of these claims sit in the Patent Office while legislators weigh arguments over what to do with them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Concerns over the privatization of the genome fueled much of the animosity between the two major research camps that fought to be the first to decode the human genome. The government-led Human Genome Project published every letter of the genome on the Internet as they decoded it. Meanwhile, Celera, and other private companies filed thousands of patent applications for genes and gene fragments as they discovered them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; At issue for many researchers, including those at public institutions, is not so much the patenting of genes, but the terms of those patents. Many acknowledge that patent protection is key to gaining support from investors. Without some guarantee that they will have proprietary rights over the focus of their research, few companies are willing to put forth the millions of dollars required to further that research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The problem, critics say, is that so many of the applications currently pending at the Patent Office seek patent protection that is overly broad. An example they point to is a patent that was granted to the firm Human Genome Sciences for the CCR-5 gene, which is important in AIDS research. The patent allows the company to charge other researchers wishing to study CCR-5 a royalty on any work they do with the gene. This type of protection, critics argue, greatly limits the amount of research that will be conducted on a potentially important gene. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As more cases like this emerge, a public already uncomfortable with the privatization of a decidedly public resource is pressuring the Patent Office to change its patent criteria in order to accommodate this quickly evolving scientific field.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Why is the sequencing of the human genome considered such an important and historic event? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What are the possible effects of patenting genes on current research efforts? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Do you think genes should be patented? Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Sea Behind the Dunes" tracks the return of spawning alewife fish from the open ocean back to the freshwater streams and ponds where they were born.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Sea Behind the Dunes" charts the life history of the alewife, a species of fish that hatches in fresh water, spends most of its life at sea, then each year of adulthood makes the treacherous journey back to its native streams and ponds to breed.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>In nearly every way, the alewife is a nondescript silver-colored little fish. Individuals spend their lives hidden in enormous schools of their own kind, flashing and darting away from would-be predators. One aspect of the alewife's life, however, is far from average. Unlike most fish species, which spend their entire lives in either fresh or salt water, the alewife, during critical stages of its life, moves intrepidly from the open ocean into a dramatically different freshwater environment -- and back again -- encountering innumerable dangers along the way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The spawning behavior of the alewife mirrors that of another, larger and better-known group of fish: the salmon. Like salmon, alewives hatch in freshwater streams and ponds. After spending their first several months in fresh water, young alewife fry move out of their natal streams along the eastern coast of North America and into the Atlantic Ocean. They spend the next four or five years at sea, eating mostly plankton and smaller fish, and growing quickly in this productive ecosystem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Although very little is known about the life of the alewife during its first several years in the ocean, studies have found that at least some groups of alewives migrate great distances -- as far as 1,200 miles along the Atlantic seaboard -- probably in search of food. By the age of four or five, however, the alewife has reached sexual maturity and is ready to spawn. Cued by changes in day length and water temperature, alewives begin swimming en masse toward their natal streams, where they face a gauntlet of predators and human-made obstacles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The alewife's spawning voyages are inherently treacherous, but twentieth-century agriculture and industrialization, especially in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states, have made them even more so. For example, by the mid-1900s, dams had cropped up on stream after stream, impeding the efforts of alewives trying to get to their native spawning grounds. Pollution from fields and factories has also killed countless spawning alewives or the eggs they managed to lay. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Miraculously, the alewife has persisted despite the threats to its well-being. Through decades of environmental degradation, populations of alewives have continued to breed successfully, albeit in much smaller numbers. This is due in part to the fish's ability as a hearty generalist to withstand less-than-optimal conditions. Today, environmental groups and agencies are cleaning up coastal waterways, dismantling dams, and, where necessary, restocking alewife populations. Slowly these vigorous little fish are reclaiming the important place they once held in the coastal food chain.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; The female alewife lays up to 200,000 eggs at a time, but only a fraction of that number will survive. What do you think happens to the others? Contrast this with another animal that has only one baby at a time. What are the advantages of each reproductive pattern? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Is the individual alewife important? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Would you describe the alewife as a freshwater or saltwater fish? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What is imprinting?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment discusses the physical adaptations that give several nocturnal animals a heightened sense of hearing. Footage from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Mystery of the Senses: Hearing."</annotation>
      <synopsis>How is sound created, and how do animals hear? This video segment explores the nighttime worlds of the desert fox and the barn owl, whose heightened sense of hearing allows them to travel and find food while most other animals lie low and wait for daylight. Footage from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Mystery of the Senses: Hearing."</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Most mammals and birds rely primarily on their sense of sight to get by in the world. They are guided mostly by their eyes as they search for the resources they need and steer clear of dangers that lie in their path. Certain conditions, however, make it difficult for animals to get around by sight alone. Nighttime is the most obvious of these. Without the aid of artificial light, we humans move through the dark with great caution, at risk for injury from unseen obstacles. Many animals are little better than humans at maneuvering in total darkness and so spend nighttime at rest. Other animals, however, are most active at night, and this requires a set of adaptations that heighten not only their sense of sight but their sense of hearing as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Owls, especially those species that hunt almost exclusively at night, have evolved a particularly heightened sense of hearing. Some, including the barn owl (a species whose hearing has been studied more than almost any other animal), can locate prey even in complete darkness. To do this, owls rely, in part, on some obvious physical features. Many owls have a large "facial ruff," the concave disc of stiff feathers at the front of their head that helps channel sound into their ears. Their ear holes are also quite large compared to those of other animals. These physical traits, however, tell only part of the story. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Far more important to the owl's heightened sense of hearing is the complex way the owl's brain processes sounds. To assess whether a sound comes from the right or left, the owl's brain measures the difference in time that the sound takes to reach each ear. The difference is usually less than 200 millionths of a second, depending on how far to the right or left the sound originated. Owls analyze sounds originating from above or below in a similar manner. With ear holes positioned at slightly different heights on the sides of their heads -- one slightly above eye level and the other an equal distance below -- owls can detect subtle differences in the vertical positions of sound sources. Sound coming from above, for example, will be slightly louder in the higher ear. A sound that is equally loud in both ears must come from a source at eye level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Perhaps most amazing is the ability of the barn owl (and probably other species of owls) to create in its mind an image of the world based on sound alone. Scientists have discovered that the owl's brain interprets information from its ears in much the same way our brain interprets information from our eyes. The owl's ears are linked to an area in the midbrain, which contains about 10,000 cells called space-specific neurons. Only one small subset of neurons in this network will respond to sounds from any given location. Thus, based on the pattern of neurons being stimulated, the owl's brain can determine, with great accuracy, the location of a potential prey animal, its direction of movement, and, to some degree, its size. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experiment in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/22s1_hearing.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt; with what people hear when conversations are taking place simultaneously.</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Mystery of Animal Pathfinders" explores honeybee communication and navigation.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Mystery of Animal Pathfinders" explores the world of honeybees: how they communicate information about food sources with their hivemates, and how, once in flight, they find their way to the flowers that provide nectar and pollen.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>In a healthy hive, the hum of infertile female worker bees is incessant. And while all of this activity may seem frenetic, it's anything but random. Every worker has a job to do, determined by which of the three life stages she is in. Each adult life stage is characterized by the specific set of tasks that occupy the bee during that stage. Young workers (1 to 12 days old) clean cells, nurse the brood, and tend the queen. Middle-aged workers (12 to 20 days old) build the comb, store nectar and pollen brought by forager bees, and help maintain the temperature of the hive. At about the age of 20 days, workers begin to travel regularly outside the hive as foragers, collecting the nectar and pollen that sustain the colony. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Many of the honeybee's behaviors are innate. Young workers know automatically when and how to care for the eggs and the developing pupae. Likewise, bees appear to interpret and respond automatically to the "waggle dance," the language foraging bees use to tell other bees in the hive where to find food. Foraging bees instinctively know to fly a course that is the same number of degrees to the right or left of the sun as the dancing bee's orientation relative to vertical. But despite the innate behaviors that guide the actions of bees within a colony, it appears that experience plays an important role outside the hive -- and this may explain, at least in part, why only the oldest bees do the foraging for the colony. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; According to a recent study, young worker bees make dozens of "orientation flights" long before they begin foraging for nectar. In this way they are able to learn the lay of the land before having to put this knowledge to use while searching for food. Researchers in England followed the activities of young honeybees tagged with tiny radar transponders. (The little antennae that the scientists attached to the backs of the bees weighed less than the average load of pollen bees carry.) The study found that non-foraging-age bees -- those younger than 20 days -- began with short flights outside the hive but, over time, increased the distances they flew, ultimately flying as many as five kilometers from the hive in a single flight. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This pattern suggests that bees learn the features of the landscape around the hive in a progressive fashion. By making multiple flights to and from the hive, bees view the hive and landmarks from many different directions. This knowledge, researchers believe, may be crucial to the bees' effectiveness as foragers, both in interpreting the dances of their hivemates and in providing information about food sources they've found to their hivemates.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; How does a bee know how to communicate with the other bees in the hive? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Bees do not have very good vision. How, other than by sight, can a bee find pollen or find its way home again?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Leopards" Web site presents a wide variety of ways in which animals use coloration to their advantage.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Leopards" Web site presents a gallery of images depicting the wide variety of ways in which animals -- both predators and prey -- conceal themselves from other animals.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>In the animal kingdom, things are not always what they appear to be. Many animals use coloration or particular behaviors -- standing motionless, for instance -- to avoid being detected by other animals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The monarch butterfly benefits from its reputation for being foul-tasting, even poisonous if eaten in large quantities. Most birds, having attempted to eat a monarch once, will never try again. They recognize instantly the orange-and-black pattern on the butterflies when they see it, and they know enough to stay away. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; What these experienced birds don't know, however, is that some of the monarchs they so assiduously avoid could be imposters. The viceroy butterfly, an entirely nonpoisonous species, has evolved a striking resemblance to the monarch and has benefited greatly as a result. Had the monarch not established that an orange-and-black coloration means &lt;em&gt;poison&lt;/em&gt;, the viceroy population would be a lot smaller than it is today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Sometimes the environment plays an important role in the effectiveness of an animal's coloration. One important example is the peppered moth of England. Prior to industrialization and the pollution that came with it, the trees and rocks around Manchester were covered with a layer of very light-colored lichen. So too were the majority of peppered moths in the region very light in color prior to the mid-1800s. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; By the late 1800s, however, the environment around Manchester was changing rapidly. Pollution from coal-fired power plants and factories was killing off the lichen and blackening the surfaces of trees and rocks. Soon, the light coloration of the peppered moths became a liability rather than an asset. Experiments showed that birds found and ate light-colored moths in much larger numbers than they did darker moths of the same species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A mutation in some peppered moths causes darker coloration. Before pollution darkened the environment, the number of dark moths remained low -- in part because they were preyed upon more heavily than their light-colored, better-hidden cousins. In an environment covered in black soot, however, the dark moths fared quite well, so that by the end of the 1800s around Manchester, England, dark peppered moths formed more than 95 percent of the moth population. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The original research on this phenomenon was conducted in the 1950s. However, more recent studies have confirmed the early conclusions. Indeed, a study published in 1998 found that higher percentages of light-colored peppered moths were showing up again in populations around Manchester as levels of coal pollution diminished. The study also confirmed the validity of the original study's conclusion about the cause of the color change, stating that, "Differential bird predation of the [light] and [dark] forms, in habitats affected by industrial pollution to different degrees, is the primary influence on the evolution of melanism in the peppered moth."</backgrounder>

      <synopsis>This interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Crocodiles!" Web site details some of the physical and behavioral characteristics that have enabled crocodiles to survive and thrive for 200 million years -- despite the environmental conditions that drove the dinosaurs to extinction.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>In the animal kingdom, crocodiles are the consummate survivors. Having arisen some 200 million years ago, they have outlived the dinosaurs by some 65 million years. Given their longevity, it is clear that crocodiles were well adapted not only to the environment in which the dinosaurs flourished, but also to some dramatically different conditions since then. The fossil record tells us that ancient crocodiles looked nearly identical to crocodiles living today. Somehow crocodiles survived the event that caused the dinosaur extinction, and continue to thrive in spite of more recent human-induced changes in the environment that have caused countless other species to become extinct. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Biologists attribute the success of crocodiles, at least in part, to their ability to withstand incredible bouts of starvation. In fact, it is not uncommon for crocodiles to go without food for an entire year. Though under such conditions they become desperately thin, they remain active and capable of feeding whenever the opportunity arises. Their ability to do this owes a lot to their cold-bloodedness. Warm-blooded animals burn up to 80 percent of the calories they eat simply maintaining their body temperature. Crocodiles have no such requirement, and this may explain their ability to survive through difficult times.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Why do you think crocodiles are camouflaged? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why do you think crocodiles lie in water with their bodies almost completely submerged?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>The nutrient-rich waters surrounding Cocos Island set the stage for astounding predator-prey interactions, as seen in this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Island of Sharks."</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt; Cocos Island, a remote volcanic summit in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, serves as a beacon for hungry predators, including thousands of hammerhead sharks that travel here each year in search of prey. This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Island of Sharks" depicts some of the common predator-prey interactions that take place in the nutrient-rich waters surrounding the island. &lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>There is safety in numbers, as the saying goes, and fish seem to understand this concept instinctively. Countless species of fish gather and swim in large groups, called schools. Many of the species that congregate around Cocos Island -- far off the western coast of Central America -- are no exception, forming huge schools that move with the coordination of one large individual. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To humans, though, swimming in such amazing synchrony looks like an invitation for trouble. After all, a large school is far more conspicuous and enticing than a single, small fish, and a predator lucky enough to find such a large group could seemingly eat its fill with very little effort. So why do so many species of fish form schools? What are the advantages and disadvantages for the individual and for the species? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Many scientists agree that defense is the most likely reason why fish form schools (and why birds fly in flocks, rodents live in colonies, and so on). There are several explanations for how schooling behavior protects prey fish from their predators. First, large groups inevitably have a better chance of detecting approaching predators, simply because there are more eyes keeping watch. Second, individual fish swimming in a group can effectively use other members of the group as predator shields. And third, although it is impossible to know exactly what predators experience, it seems likely that a predator attacking a large school would find it difficult to focus on any one individual when members of a large group scatter in many different directions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; So even if most fish in a preyed-upon school get eaten, it is likely that some will get away alive and pass the genes that encourage schooling behavior on to the next generation. In this way, schooling helps protect the species, even if it can't always protect the individual. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Despite the protection that schooling provides to prey fish, ocean predators, including large fish and whales, occasionally get the best of schools of prey by hunting in schools of their own. Cooperating with one another, predators can cut off the escape routes of their prey, keeping them in a group, and taking one individual after another until not a single fish is left. In this way, predators have evolved, and in some cases learned, to use their prey species' schooling behavior to their own advantage. Typically, though, a prey fish is far better off than an individual swimming the open ocean alone, and so, the behavior persists.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; What benefits does an individual fish derive from schooling behavior? What benefits does the species as a whole derive from schooling? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; If it is sometimes possible for predators to eat every individual in a school, why does schooling behavior persist? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How have some animals countered the defensive schooling behavior of their prey?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Tales from the Hive" Web site explores the methods honeybees use to communicate to their hivemates the location, quantity, and quality of nearby food sources.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In this interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Tales from the Hive," you will learn how honeybees communicate with their hivemates using intricate "dances" that provide important information about nearby food sources. Then you'll have a chance to climb inside a beehive. Watch closely. Can you understand what the scout is trying to tell you?</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>A single honeybee colony typically contains 20,000 to 30,000 bees. At any given time, several thousand female worker bees may be gathering nectar and pollen from food sources spread over an area of up to 40 square miles. The flower patches where bees find nectar and pollen differ not only in distance from the hive and size of the patch, but also in richness -- and a patch's richness decreases as more and more bees forage there. It's clear that without some way for bees to convey information about the distance, direction, quantity, and quality of nearby food sources, the odds of a worker bee finding food would be left primarily to chance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Over the course of thousands, if not millions, of years, honeybees have evolved an extraordinary form of communication: a behavior that scientists call "dancing." Although honeybee dances -- one called the "waggle dance" and one called the "round dance" -- may seem chaotic to most human observers, researchers have learned to interpret them and are beginning to understand the wealth of information they hold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Worker bees perform the waggle dance on a special vertical "dance floor," which is located near the entrance of the hive to facilitate quick entry and exit of foragers. Arriving back at the nest, a scout bee with news of food immediately proceeds to the dance floor, where other bees waiting for news gather around her. The scout communicates several key pieces of information during the dance. In the case of the waggle dance, for example, the longer she waggles, the farther the flower patch lies from the hive. The more vigorously she dances, the richer the source of food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Perhaps most astonishingly, a dancing bee can also indicate the &lt;em&gt;direction&lt;/em&gt; of the food source she just visited. The angle her dance deviates from a vertical line shows others the angle they should fly relative to the sun when they leave the hive. In other words, if the food source lies in the same direction as the sun, she will dance straight up along the dance floor (remember that a hive hangs vertically). If the food source is in the opposite direction of the sun, she will dance straight down the dance floor. If the food source lies along a line 20 degrees to the right of the sun, the angle of the bee's movement will be 20 degrees to the right of vertical.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Why is it advantageous for bees to communicate about food? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How do you think bees communicate when it isn't sunny?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Everest" Web site lets you take the same brain quizzes that researchers used to test the brain function of climbers on Mount Everest.</annotation>
      <synopsis>And you think classroom quizzes are difficult! Try answering a series of confusing word problems while breathing one-third less oxygen than you're breathing now. That's what researchers made a group of climbers do at several stops on their way to the summit of Mount Everest. Check out this interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Everest" Web site, and see how you do.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Before 1953, not a single person had climbed to the summit of Mount Everest, the highest point on earth. Because the air at the summit is so thin -- it contains 1/3 less oxygen than air at sea level -- many people doubted that it was even possible. Physiologists speculated that a climber, even if he or she were breathing bottled oxygen, would be unable to reach the top because the amount of supplemental oxygen required on the ascent would simply be too much for one person to carry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The doubters were proven wrong in 1953, when Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay climbed the peak breathing bottled oxygen. They were proven wrong again in 1978, when two other climbers became the first to reach the peak without supplemental oxygen. However, the doubts expressed by the nay-sayers were not without merit. Most climbers and physiologists agree that if Everest were just a bit higher -- as little as 1,000 feet higher -- it would be unclimbable without bottled oxygen. Indeed, even well below the 29,028-foot summit, humans can't survive for more than a few days. Climbers call the area above 26,000 feet the "Death Zone" because of the debilitating and ultimately fatal effects this environment has on the body. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The low air pressure at extreme altitudes not only reduces the amount of oxygen in the air (by reducing the density of air), but also makes the transfer of the oxygen from the lung tissue into the lung capillaries a less efficient process. There is simply less pressure to push the air through the capillary walls. To compound this problem, as a climber works harder at extremely high altitudes, his or her heart beats faster. This causes blood to pass more rapidly through the capillaries, giving the oxygen less time to move from the lung tissue into the bloodstream. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; High-altitude climbers suffer in a variety of ways from the low-oxygen conditions they experience on peaks like Everest. Despite the body's efforts to compensate - by increasing breathing rate and, over time, increasing the production of red blood cells - tissues become starved of oxygen and slowly begin to die. Even below the Death Zone, experienced climbers suffer from the lack of oxygen. Most obviously, they tire more quickly than they do at sea level because the oxygen their cells require to burn food molecules are in short supply. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Tests, like the memory test presented to climbers on Everest, also show that the brains of climbers function more slowly at high altitudes. With too little oxygen fueling their brain cells, the ability of climbers to process information slows. They find it difficult to remember instructions, recognize familiar objects and images, and solve simple logic problems. In general, say physiologists, the higher a person climbs, the slower he or she thinks. This slow thinking, some believe, can have dire consequences in an environment in which technical proficiency and rational thought are critical to one's survival.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Why do you think low oxygen levels impair the brain functions of mountain climbers? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Can you think of other situations in which brain function would be impaired?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment follows neurophysiologist Allen Counter as he studies an epidemic of hearing loss in Moriussaq, Greenland, one of the quietest places on Earth. Footage from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Mystery of the Senses: Hearing."</annotation>
      <synopsis>When a mysterious epidemic of hearing loss cropped up in Moriussaq, a remote village in northern Greenland and one of the quietest places on Earth, neurophysiologist Allen Counter took notice. This video segment follows Counter as he works with Inuit hunters in an attempt to find the cause of their deafness. Footage from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Mystery of the Senses: Hearing."</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>It seems unlikely that people living in one of the quietest places on earth would suffer from hearing loss. But deafness is just what neurophysiologist Allen Counter discovered among the Inuit (formerly called Eskimos) living in the northern Greenland village of Moriussaq. Counter found that males in this community begin losing their hearing at about the age of 10. Their hearing diminishes steadily throughout their lives until, by the age of 60, most Inuit men have lost most or all of their hearing. Girls and women, by contrast, experience little or no hearing loss for the duration of their lives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To find the explanation for hearing loss among Inuit men, Counter went out onto the ice. Following the men on their seal hunts, he observed the likely cause of their problem. While traditionally, hunters used harpoons to spear seals, modern Inuit hunters use rifles. They wait at the seals' breathing holes and, when the animals come to the surface for a breath, they shoot. Exposure to these sudden and extremely loud explosions of gunfire, again and again over many years, Counter hypothesized, must be the cause of the progressive hearing loss he observed in the men. Lab tests confirmed his hypothesis and also provided a physiological explanation for how it happens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; At the end of the canal leading into the ear there is a tough membrane known as the tympanic membrane, or eardrum. When sound waves reach the eardrum, they cause it to vibrate. These vibrations, in turn, are transferred along three small, interconnected bones into a snail-shaped, fluid-filled tube called the cochlea. The cochlea is lined with receptor cells that have microscopic hairlike structures called stereocilia emanating from them. Receptor cells transform the vibrations that stimulate the stereocilia into electric signals that are picked up by nerve calls and are perceived by the brain as sound. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Sudden loud noises like gunshots, however, flatten the stereocilia, just as a strong gust of wind can knock down trees. And while some receptor cells survive and recover from being battered by loud sounds, others are damaged beyond repair. Indeed, field tests of the Inuit showed that after each gunshot, the hunters experienced a temporary loss of hearing, followed by recovery. The recovery was seldom complete, however. Each time, the hunters' hearing returned, but not to the same level as before. They lost receptor cells, and hearing, one gunshot at a time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; While researchers like Allen Counter are working to develop artificial cochleas, they have had very little success thus far. According to doctors, the best cure for hearing loss, now and probably for a very long time, is no cure at all: It is prevention. Doctors recommend that people working in loud environments, using loud machinery, and certainly firing guns, use adequate ear protection.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Would you expect people who live in the Arctic to have a more-acute or less-acute sense of hearing? Explain your reasons. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How has the changing way of life for the inhabitants of the Arctic resulted in widespread early hearing loss? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Are people in your community exposed to loud noises that might cause hearing loss? Do you think people are aware of the effects of noise and how hearing loss can be prevented?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Mystery of Animal Pathfinders" explores the migratorial exploits of monarch butterflies.</annotation>
      <synopsis>It is one of the most impressive displays of migratorial instinct and ability in the animal kingdom: Each year millions of monarch butterflies migrate from eastern Canada and the United States to Mexico -- a journey of more than two thousand miles for some. This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Mystery of Animal Pathfinders" explores why monarchs make such an epic journey and how they manage to do it.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The mass migration of monarch butterflies from eastern Canada and the United States to isolated mountain ranges in central Mexico certainly rates as one of the most impressive natural phenomena in the world. Even among birds and mammals, such travel feats are uncommon. Yet, each fall these wispy insects embark on a journey thousands of miles long to a place none of them has ever been before. They fly with only their innate sense of timing and direction to guide them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Although mass migrations of monarchs occur every year, only every third or fourth generation of monarchs makes the epic flight to Mexico. Between March and September, up to four generations of monarchs may be born, but the majority of these butterflies typically fly only short distances, moving northward during the spring and summer months as they follow the growth of milkweed, their primary food source. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; What seems to decide for the monarchs whether they will be local butterflies or far-flung travelers is when during the spring/summer season they are born. First-generation monarchs, the offspring of the generation that spent the winter in Mexico, typically hatch from their eggs in early spring. After spending two weeks as caterpillars and two weeks in the chrysalis stage, they spend their month of adulthood mating, laying eggs, and moving northward. Second-generation and most third-generation monarchs, born in late spring and early summer, live out their two months of life much as their parents before them, mating, laying eggs, and following the milkweed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Fourth-generation and some third-generation monarchs, however, hatch much later in the season -- July through September -- and are subject to different conditions. These conditions, including shorter days, cooler temperatures, and older and lower-quality milkweed, foreshadow the coming of winter and are probably some of the factors that cue the butterflies that it is time to migrate south. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The journey to Mexico from the eastern United States, experts estimate, takes the average monarch about two months. Like birds, the butterflies probably use a combination of the angle of the sun in the sky and the earth's magnetic fields to guide them southward. It remains a mystery, however, exactly how the monarchs find the relatively tiny patch of land in central Mexico that they will call home throughout the winter. Here the fourth-generation monarchs will stay for the next five or six months -- far longer than the entire life span of their parents. During this time, in a nonreproductive state called diapause, they will not mate or eat. At last, in early spring, the monarchs will come out of diapause, mate, and begin their egg-laying journey northward, where the entire life cycle of this intrepid insect will begin again.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; What characteristics of the Mexican environment make it a good place for the monarchs to overwinter? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What would happen to the monarchs if the milkweed supply diminished? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How do you think the caterpillars and adult monarchs survive when they are so brightly colored and can be seen easily by predators such as birds?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Leopards of the Night" Web site highlights the nighttime habits and abilities of a wide range of nocturnal creatures.</annotation>
      <synopsis>If you've ever stumbled through the woods on a moonless night, you may have wondered how nocturnal creatures move about with such apparent ease. This interactive feature from &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Leopards of the Night" Web site explores some of the most important adaptations of the nocturnal eye and highlights the nighttime habits of a range of creatures that rely on these adaptations.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The ability of nocturnal animals to function in what human eyes would perceive as complete darkness seems almost magical. Nearly everyone has experienced the sense of panic that sets in shortly after a power outage. With the sudden loss of artificial light, you realize that you can't see a thing and you feel vulnerable. Moving about in the darkness, even in the familiar environment of your own house, is hazardous. The pile of books you left on the floor, the dreaded coffee table leg -- these and other dangers lie in wait for you. Finally, after fumbling around in the dark, you locate the flashlight. Turning it on, you feel your world open up again. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The nighttime world is never closed for nocturnal animals. Unlike humans, these creatures possess adaptations, acquired over millions of years and countless generations, that allow them to see even when the night sky is at its darkest. In most ways, a nocturnal animal's eyes are very similar to our own. Like cameras, they possess a lens, an exposure meter, and automatic focus. Nocturnal eyes differ from ours, however, in their ability to maximize the amount of light they receive, as well as in their sensitivity to that light. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Most nocturnal animals have eyes that are inordinately large relative to their body size. This adaptation, in conjunction with the ability most nocturnal creatures have to dilate their pupils far wider than humans can, maximizes the amount of light that can enter the eye. Most nocturnal creatures also have a reflective membrane inside their eyes, called a tapetum. This membrane helps the eye conserve the light it takes in by reflecting it back toward the retina before it escapes the eye completely. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In addition, the retinas of nocturnal eyes are equipped with a high percentage of one of the two types of light-receptor cells. These cells, called rods, are extremely light sensitive. In fact, their sensitivity is about 500 times greater than the sensitivity of the other type of receptor cells, called cones. Only one photon, the smallest measurable unit of light, is required to stimulate a rod into sending a signal to the brain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; There is a price for this increased sensitivity, however. Rods do not provide the high resolution and color vision that cones do, and so many animals that can see better at night than humans do typically see more poorly during the day than we do. This trade-off between light sensitivity and vision quality is the compromise that has accompanied the evolution of night vision. However, there must certainly have been a strong evolutionary benefit to some groups of animals of being active at night. Whether night activity allowed these animals to escape desert heat during the daytime or avoid competition with or predation by creatures that were dominant during the day, the behavior persisted, and adaptations that aided their nighttime vision continued to evolve.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; What differences would you expect to find between the eye structure of animals that are active primarily in the daytime and that of animals that are active at night? Support your answers. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What are the challenges faced by animals that hunt for their food at night?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Mystery of Animal Pathfinders" explores how the migratory patterns of shorebirds have evolved to coincide with the spawning of horseshoe crabs.</annotation>
      <synopsis>There are many strategies animals use for staying close to their food sources, as this video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Mystery of Animal Pathfinders" explains. One of the most remarkable of these strategies, however, is demonstrated by the red knot, a species of shorebird that flies 20,000 miles annually in its never-ending search for food, especially the eggs of spawning horseshoe crabs.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The timing of shorebird migration is no accident. The long-distance travels of these birds have evolved over countless generations, just as the physical characteristics of a species may change over time. Year after year, the process of natural selection has refined shorebird migrations. Birds that travel efficiently and that time their travels well are rewarded with breeding success, while birds that leave too early or too late pay the price with unsuccessful reproduction -- and sometimes their lives. In this way, dozens of species of shorebirds have come to rely on the bounty the ocean provides en route between their wintering and their breeding grounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Eggs deposited on the beach by spawning horseshoe crabs are particularly important to shorebirds migrating along the Mid-Atlantic coast of North America. In the spring and early summer, from Maine to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, hundreds of thousands of horseshoe crabs move to shallow water to begin their breeding cycle. Males congregate first; females arrive shortly after, secreting a pheromone to attract mates. A male who has been successfully courted follows his mate closely as she moves ashore to lay 3,000 to 4,000 grayish-green eggs in a single shallow nest dug into the sand. The male fertilizes the eggs when the female begins to crawl away and drags him over the nest. Females may lay up to 90,000 eggs, in multiple nests and with multiple partners, each season. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; If shorebirds time their migration with the peak of horseshoe crab spawning, they will double their weight during a two- to three-week stay along the Mid-Atlantic coast. They gorge on eggs, many of which are on the surface of the sand, uncovered by the spawning efforts of horseshoe crabs laying their own eggs. Scientists estimate that during a stopover, the average shorebird consumes more than 100,000 horseshoe crab eggs. Until recently, there were enough horseshoe crab eggs to meet the demand. But that's changing quickly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The number of horseshoe crabs spawning on Mid-Atlantic beaches has declined in recent years, most likely due to the loss of spawning habitat along the Atlantic coast, and to the three-fold increase since 1990 of the use of horseshoe crabs as bait for other species. In Delaware Bay, which contains the world's largest concentration of horseshoe crabs, the number of spawning females per season has dropped from 1.2 million to 400,000 in just the last four years. Scientists agree that this alarming downturn is greatly impacting populations of shorebirds that have come to rely so heavily on horseshoe crab eggs.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Why do you think that 70 percent of birds cannot be tracked as they migrate south? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Horseshoe crabs have come to the same beaches to lay their eggs for hundreds of millions of years. How does this compare to the migratory pattern of red knots?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;Interactive NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Animal Pathfinders" describes the life history of the sea turtle.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;Interactive NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Animal Pathfinders" examines the life history of the sea turtle, from its solitary habits at sea to its reliance upon beach habitats for breeding and egg-laying.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Sea turtles are large, long-lived, air-breathing reptiles that spend all but a short period of their lives in the open ocean. The stout-bodied, primitive appearance of these creatures suggests an early and long evolutionary history. Indeed, scientists who study the fossil record have found remains of sea turtles, nearly identical to those that exist today, in sediments laid down 150 million years ago. They conclude that sea turtles were swimming the oceans long before the last of the dinosaurs became extinct. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Unfortunately, while sea turtles have spent millions of years apparently perfectly adapted to undisturbed beaches and nutrient-rich ocean waters, they are far less prepared for a world teeming with human activity. Today, every one of the seven species of sea turtles that exist worldwide is listed by international conservation agencies as threatened or in danger of becoming extinct. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One of the main reasons for the collapse of sea turtle populations over the last 50 years is that the animals require two environments highly prized by humans: beaches and coastal waters. Sea turtle eggs incubate buried in the sand, and so each year females crawl ashore to lay their eggs in an area of the beach high enough that the eggs won't be flooded. Most females nest at least twice in a given breeding season; some may nest up to 10 times in a season. A female, however, will not nest in consecutive years, typically skipping one or two years before returning to the same beach. But when she does return, it's often within a few hundred yards of where she laid her eggs previously. Commercial development along these traditional nesting zones has dramatically decreased the amount of beach available to sea turtles. Beaches have eroded or become too compact for turtles to lay eggs. In addition, artificial lights along beaches deter females from laying eggs or disorient hatchlings attempting to make their way to the water. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Perhaps just as important to the decline of sea turtles is the impact humans have at sea. Sea turtles spend the majority of their lives in the open ocean, typically not very far offshore, where they feed on a variety of mollusks, crustaceans, jellyfish, and sea plants. Their close proximity to shore, however, puts turtles at risk of being hunted for their meat and shells or getting caught accidentally in fishing nets and drowning. Many turtles also die from ingesting garbage, like plastic bags, that they may mistake for food. Unfortunately, very little is known about the habits and habitats of turtles when they're at sea. With recent advances in radio-tracking technology, researchers hope to learn more about the threats to sea turtles, so that they can conserve and expand the populations that are left.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Can you think of any natural advantages to laying eggs on land? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How do hatchlings find the ocean? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How might commercial development along beach areas confuse hatchlings? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why do you think young turtles stay in seaweed rafts?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Shark Attack!" Web site details the six senses sharks use to find and capture their prey.</annotation>
      <synopsis>A wounded seal swims slowly toward shore, while a shark patrols the water nearby, looking for an easy target. In this interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Shark Attack!" Web site, understanding the six senses sharks use to locate and capture their prey may give you the edge you need to help the seal reach land safely.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Ancient relatives of sharks first appeared in the world's oceans about 400 million years ago. Today, sharks are classified among the group of fish called the elasmobranchs, which also includes rays and skates. There are well over 350 known species of sharks, and new species are discovered nearly every year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Although sharks are fish, scientists distinguish between them and bony fish. Sharks and other elasmobranchs are cartilaginous fish, meaning that their skeletons are made of cartilage, not bone. Their skin is covered with denticles, toothlike scales that differ from the scales of bony fish. And they have five, six, or seven gill slits per side, not one per side like bony fish. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Sharks reproduce in one of three ways. Some sharks lay egg cases with developing embryos inside. These sharks are called oviparous (producing eggs that hatch outside the body). Other sharks carry young internally, nourished by a placenta before being born alive. These sharks are called viviparous (giving birth to live offspring). Finally, some sharks bear live young that developed internally within egg cases and without attachment to the mother. These sharks are called ovoviviparous (producing eggs that hatch within the female's body). Gestation lasts anywhere from nine months to as long as two years. Depending on the species, a female may produce anywhere from 1 to 100 young at a time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The average life span of most species of shark is less than 25 years. One species, the spiny dogfish, however, is known to live as long as most humans: 70 to 100 years. Unlike many creatures, sharks continue growing for the duration of their lives.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; How do the shark's senses make it the "perfect predator"? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Compare the sense organs of the shark with those of a familiar land animal. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Do you think bony fish have the same sense organs as sharks? Explain your answer.&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment explores the sense of taste in humans -- why we have it, and what happens when we lose it. Footage from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Mystery of the Senses: Taste."</annotation>
      <synopsis>Do you have good taste? In this video segment, Dr. Linda Bartoshuk explores the sense of taste in humans -- why we have it, and what happens when we lose it. Learn why the sense of smell is also important to our experience of food. Footage from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Mystery of the Senses: Taste,"</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Our senses of taste and smell provide a window on the chemical world around us. We taste food in our mouth with the chemical receptors that dot our tongue, and we smell molecules suspended in the air with chemical receptors deep in our nasal passages. Without these two senses, our world would seem emptier and we would know less about it. Indeed, our senses of taste and smell not only add pleasure to our lives, they protect us from danger. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; It is clear that our senses of taste and smell serve several purposes. But these two senses are far less important than some of our other senses. The loss of our ability to taste or to smell would not have the same negative impact on our lives that sudden deafness, or even more so, blindness, would have. For many types of animals, however, the loss of their sense of smell or taste could be life threatening. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Many small mammals, such as mice, voles, and weasels, are as dependent on their sense of smell as we are on our sense of sight. These animals live close to the ground, and many are nocturnal. In these conditions smell provides far more information than vision ever could. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Fish, too, rely heavily on their ability to sense their chemical environment. These creatures have receptor cells scattered over the surface of their bodies. (Imagine having taste buds on your arms and legs, torso, and the top of your head, and thus being able to taste not only the wind as it blows by but also the surface of the chair you're sitting in!) The brain anatomy of most fish suggests the importance of being able to sense chemical information in an aquatic environment: The area of the brain that receives information from these receptor cells is typically larger than all of the brain's other sensory centers combined. These examples make it clear that the importance of a particular sense and its degree of sensitivity have evolved in a species at the same time that other characteristics were evolving. Life in dark burrows, for example, has minimized the snake's need for legs and maximized its need to taste the air with its forked tongue. Humans, in contrast, evolved from primates that spent most of their time in trees. High above the forest floor, leaping from limb to limb, our ancestors had far less use for smell and taste than for keen vision. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigate the senses involved with taste in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/22s3_taste.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; The narrator says that "sweet taste makes sure that the baby will drink the mother's milk." Do you think that 1) the milk is sweet because the baby likes the taste of sweetness; 2) the baby develops a taste for sweetness because the mother's milk is sweet; or 3) the two traits developed side by side? Give your reasons for your answer. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why doesn't food taste very good when you have a bad cold?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment explores the role of touch in the development of young animals, including humans. Footage from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Mystery of the Senses: Touch."</annotation>
      <synopsis>Why is touch so important to our physical and emotional well-being? And what happens when it is withheld? This video segment explores the role of touch in the development of young animals, including humans, and looks at the therapies parents are using to enrich the lives and minds of their infants and toddlers. Footage from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Mystery of the Senses: Touch."</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>An attentive mother dog grooms her litter of newborn pups. She licks them and, with her nose, nudges those that wander off back into the group. Few images connote the nurturing relationship of a mother with her infants better than this. For us humans, it's nearly impossible to view such a scene and not feel intuitively that the mother's treatment of the pups is good for them -- that this is the way things ought to be. The warmth, wetness, and pressure of the mother's tongue must make her babies feel safe and cared for.... But then we think, "That's ridiculous. They're just puppies. They probably wouldn't know if the mother was there or not, except that she supplies their food. Their eyes aren't even open." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; So, which is it? Do newborn animals benefit from the caresses of their mother's tongue, or are we just anthropomorphizing -- ascribing human values and motivations to animal behavior? Studies conducted on several species of mammals (especially rats and monkeys) suggest that touch during early stages of development is critical to an animal's physical and psychological well-being. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Most touch research has compared the development of animals under normal conditions with the development of animals deprived of touch. These studies have revealed strong correlations between touch deprivation and a variety of physiological, behavioral, and social problems in young animals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Researchers found that young rats and monkeys, for example, tended to grow more slowly and have weaker immune systems when deprived of touch. They were also much less likely to be inquisitive as they grew older, rarely venturing far from the nest to learn about the outside world. For monkeys it also seems that the importance of touch is absolutely essential when it comes to establishing social bonds. Touch-deprived rhesus monkeys tended to be extremely aggressive toward other monkeys and exhibited behaviors consistent with the human emotions of anger and depression. Furthermore, monkeys that were deprived of touch when young went on to raise their own offspring in a similarly distant manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; It's not difficult to understand why being raised without touch would interfere with socialization. What's surprising is that the lack of touch can have such profound effects on so many aspects of a young animal's life, from its immunity to its adventurousness. And there's little doubt that the same is true for humans, too. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Test the skin's range of sensitivity in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/22s4_touch.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt;.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Why do you think massage helps children sleep and helps their relationships with adults? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How does the sense of touch help an organism survive in its environment? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How important do you think the sense of touch is compared to the other senses?

      <annotation>This video segment explores how humans perceive the world through vision. Footage from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Mystery of the Senses: Vision."</annotation>
      <synopsis>How do our eyes receive visual information from the world around us, and how does our brain make sense of it? This video segment pieces together the components of human visual perception. Footage from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Mystery of the Senses: Vision."</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Humans, like most other mammals, are primarily sight oriented, which means that our eyes are our dominant sense organs. The reason we rely so heavily on vision most likely lies in our evolutionary history. Millions of years ago, the ancestors of Homo sapiens were small, tree-dwelling primates. Their way of life -- leaping from limb to limb and paying a high price for mistakes -- favored animals with good vision and selected against individuals that could not see as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Life in the trees required not only visual acuity, but good depth perception as well. An animal whose life depended on knowing precisely where the next handhold was had to be able to estimate the ever-changing distances it saw while moving quickly through the tree canopy. To do this, the animal needed eyes positioned near the front of its head, like an owl, for example, rather than on the sides of its head, like a deer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; What is most important about a forward-facing eye position -- often called binocular, or stereoscopic, vision -- is that it allows the visual fields of each eye to overlap. Overlapping visual fields provide our brain with simultaneous views of the same area from two slightly different angles; each eye picks up visual information that the other eye doesn't. When the two images arrive at the back of the eye, they stimulate the retina, which in turn sends nerve impulses to the brain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; By comparing the pattern of nerve stimuli produced by the retinas, the brain can determine an object's distance relative to other objects in view. The closer an object is to the eyes, the greater the difference between the two images and the nerve patterns they stimulate. The farther away the object, the more the two patterns resemble each other. You can observe this with your own eyes by alternating the eye with which you look at an object. Cover one eye, then switch and cover the other. The object will appear to move when you switch back and forth. But notice, an object at arm's length will appear to move more than an object on the other side of the room. This explains why distant landscapes often look like flat pictures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; View optical illusions in this &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/22s5_vision.html" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA classroom activity&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the human visual system.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; How important do you think the sense of vision is compared to the other senses? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; If a person injured a small section on one side of the visual part of the brain, what do you think might happen to his or her ability to see form, depth, and color?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Cut to the Heart" Web site highlights facts about the heart -- including its size and placement -- and will help you to understand the importance of this wondrous organ in our bodies.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Do you know where your heart is located in your body? Do you know how big it is? How often it circulates your blood? How many gallons of blood it will pump during your lifetime? This feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Cut to the Heart" Web site highlights some of the heart's most important features and functions.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The heart is a wonderfully reliable mechanical pump, beating about 100,000 times a day without our ever having to think about it. Its sole purpose is to circulate blood throughout the body. It takes oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs, where carbon dioxide can be released and more oxygen absorbed. The heart then collects the oxygenated blood as it comes from the lungs and pumps it to every part of the body, delivering oxygen to the body's cells, which need it to survive. Along the way, blood also passes through the abdomen, past cells that line the intestines and stomach, where it picks up nutrients that it will distribute to other parts of the body. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As important as it is, the heart would be useless without blood to pump. Often called "the elixir of life," blood is the fluid that carries the precious oxygen and nutrients to each of our cells. The average-sized human body contains about six quarts of blood, which is circulated completely every one to three minutes. Blood is made up primarily (about 55 percent by volume) of an amber-colored liquid called plasma. This fluid is more than 90 percent water, but it also contains fibrinogen, a protein that helps blood clot, as well as nutrients, hormones, enzymes, antibodies, and the body's waste products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One of the most important components of blood is the oxygen-carrying red blood cells. There are about 25 trillion of these cells in the entire body, and each one contains hundreds of millions of molecules of a substance called hemoglobin, which enables the cell to collect oxygen in the lungs and release it in the tissues. Red blood cells have a life span of only about four months and so must be replaced constantly. Your bone marrow produces replacement red blood cells at a rate of about 1.5 million every second. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Another important component of blood is the white blood cells. Although red blood cells outnumbered them by about 750 to 1, white blood cells are no less important. Their function is to defend against bacteria, viruses, and other foreign intruders. They do this by active consumption of the intruders -- a process called phagocytosis -- or by producing antibodies, which are proteins that kill or otherwise interfere with the intruder's normal functions. White blood cells are different from most cells in the human body in their ability to move throughout the body. They can travel against the flow of blood within the bloodstream and, despite their large size, can pass through the walls of capillaries and into damaged and diseased tissue in search of infection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Platelets are a third important component of blood. These tiny disks are not actually cells but fragments of very large cells found in the bone marrow. When blood vessels are damaged, the platelets release a substance that initiates the process of blood clotting to inhibit the loss of blood.</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Animal Imposters" shows the lightning-fast strike of the anglerfish.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Searching for food can be extremely time and labor intensive. Foraging birds seem to explore their environment endlessly in search of a few small bits of food. Cheetahs and wolves chase down their prey with incredible bursts of speed or tenacious endurance. In contrast, the anglerfish uses trickery to lure its prey to within one short strike of its monstrous mouth. This video segment explores the amazing predatory strategy of the anglerfish.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Animals whose diets consist of other animals generally work much harder to obtain food than animals whose diets consist of plants. After all, plants cannot run away or resist, while prey animals must first be captured and subdued before they can be eaten -- and most try their hardest not to become a predator's next meal. In many cases, prey animals have evolved a heightened sense of awareness, speed and agility, or disguises, all of which help them to avoid predators. Keeping pace, many predators have evolved traits that make them more effective at catching their prey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In general, carnivores use one of two different predatory strategies in their search for food. The more common of the two is called "active searching. " As the name implies, a predator using this strategy goes looking for food. Woodpeckers, for example, probe almost ceaselessly under flakes of bark in search of insects. Snakes slither into rodent burrows and other tight spaces in search of any animal that can be swallowed whole. Many other carnivorous mammals, including wolves and some species of cats, also go in active pursuit of prey. Typically, animals that use this strategy have physical or behavioral adaptations that make them more efficient pursuit predators. These include speed, endurance, cunning, and highly specialized sense organs or physical features for finding and capturing their prey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The less common of the two predatory strategies is called "sit and wait. " Again, the strategy is as straightforward as its name. It involves no high-speed chases across the savanna -- nothing as physically demanding as that. Despite the apparent simplicity of this relatively lazy strategy, however, some of the animals that use it possess traits that are as fantastic as the turbo-charged speed of the cheetah. Mostly, sit-and-wait predators rely on very good camouflage to fool their prey into believing that no danger is near. Flounder and chameleons, for example, can change the color and pattern of their skin to perfectly match and blend in with their environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Ironically, a predator using the sit-and-wait strategy is often at the mercy of the prey animal. The predator can do nothing but wait for a creature to blunder into its grasp. In fact, it is not uncommon for some sit-and-wait predators to go several weeks between meals. However, the anglerfish seen in the video, as well as some types of snapping turtles, use a slightly more active approach. These creatures use parts of their bodies to lure curious fish and other creatures to within striking distance, dramatically improving the odds for success of an otherwise passive strategy.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Why do you think the butterfly fish didn't see the anglerfish? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why do you think the anglerfish catches its prey so fast? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Can you think of two other predators that ambush their prey? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This document from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Into the Abyss" Web site describes the physical and behavioral traits of some of the least-known and most unlikely creatures on earth.</annotation>
      <synopsis>With names like umbrellamouth gulper, blackdevil anglerfish, ogrefish, football fish, and vampire squid from hell, you might expect to be surprised, even startled, by some of the creatures that inhabit that deepest parts of the ocean. You would be right to expect this. This document from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Into the Abyss" Web site describes the physical and behavioral traits of some of these bizarre and little-known sea creatures.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Most people have become accustomed to the outlandish collection of adaptations found in land animals and common ocean creatures. The elephant's trunk and the shape of the hammerhead shark's head, for example, barely raise eyebrows. We've simply seen too many of the creatures -- in pictures, on television, or in person -- to be very surprised by them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; However, many creatures that call the deep sea home live at such depths -- thousands of feet below the surface in some cases -- that they were unknown even to scientists just a few decades ago. Pair that newness with the fact that extreme conditions -- including crushing pressure, perpetual darkness, and unimaginable predators and competitors -- drive extreme adaptation, and you've got yourself a collection of creatures whose appearance will make your hair stand on end.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Choose some examples that illustrate how mouthparts and diet are related. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What are the challenges to observing these creatures alive? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Surviving Denali" Web site details the variety of ways the body can fail while climbing a high-altitude peak.</annotation>
      <synopsis>Climbing at altitude is no walk in the park. Factors like extreme cold and lack of oxygen make an ascent on a mountain like Alaska's Denali dangerous and unpredictable. This interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA&lt;/em&gt; "Surviving Denali" details the variety of ways in which the body's systems can fail during a high-altitude ascent.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>There are a number of challenges a climber faces during a high-altitude mountain expedition. Extreme weather conditions, sleep deprivation, and the extraordinary energy demands placed on the body combine to push even the fittest mountaineers to their physical limits. One environmental factor stands out, however, as perhaps the greatest challenge to high-altitude climbers: lack of oxygen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; No matter where on earth you are, the concentration of oxygen in the air is about 21 percent. Depending on the altitude, however, the density of air can vary widely. The density of a gas is the measure of how many molecules there are in a given volume. The less dense the air, the fewer molecules -- including oxygen molecules -- that air contains. On Mount Everest, the highest point on earth, for example, the air is about one-third less dense than the air at sea level, and thus contains about one-third fewer oxygen molecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In addition, the lower air pressure at high altitudes makes the transfer of oxygen from lung tissue into lung capillaries a less efficient process. There is simply less pressure to push the air through the capillary walls. To compound this problem, as a climber works harder at extremely high altitudes, his or her heart beats faster. This causes blood to pass more rapidly through the capillaries, giving the oxygen less time to move from the lung tissue into the bloodstream. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The human body's capacity to compensate for moderate gains in altitude is quite good. Most people have little difficulty going from sea level to 8,000 feet above sea level. Climbing to this altitude may cause a person's breathing rate to increase, and they may feel fatigued as the body struggles to acquire the oxygen it needs, but few people suffer more severe effects unless they continue to ascend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Serious mountaineers, of course, climb much higher than 8,000 feet -- 20,000 feet higher in the case of Mount Everest. In so doing they risk suffering the effects of altitude sickness, which ranges from headache, dizziness, and loss of appetite to more severe symptoms, including vomiting and loss of consciousness. Nearly all climbers experience at least mild symptoms of altitude sickness. Fatigue, headache, and lack of appetite are all part of the experience for some. The more extreme symptoms, however, can be life threatening, and most climbers go to great lengths to avoid them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The most common cause of altitude sickness is ascending too high, too quickly. While the body responds immediately to a lack of oxygen by quickening its breathing rate, there are limits to this response. Other ways in which the body compensates -- by increasing blood pressure and the flow of blood in the lungs, and by increasing the production of red blood cells -- take several days to several weeks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is part of the reason mountaineers are unable to climb from 10,000 feet to the 28,000-foot summit of Everest in a single day or even several days. Not only do they need to rest along the way, but their bodies also need time to adapt physiologically to the low-oxygen conditions. This process, called acclimatization, involves climbing a mountain in stages. Climbers will ascend several thousand feet and then wait for their bodies to adapt to the lack of oxygen before continuing higher. Most climbers do this several times en route to a high-altitude summit.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; What do you think are the two or three most significant challenges the human body faces at very high altitudes? Give your reasons for choosing these. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Choose one part of the body from the diagram. Explain (1) how altitude causes a problem for that body part; (2) the symptoms produced; and (3) how to relieve the problem. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Think about how the human body regulates itself. What do you think might be happening in the body that results in the symptoms you listed above?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Which part of your brain controls your ability to swallow? Your instinct to survive? And how do all the brain's parts function cooperatively? Find out with this interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Coma" Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Coma" Web site shows you how to make a model of the brain, using just your hands, a ball, and a pencil. With your newfound knowledge of brain anatomy and function, you will then diagnose the types of head injuries your patients have, given the specific symptoms each presents.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Head-injury statistics are staggering. Head injury is the leading cause of death among children and young adults in the United States. According to the &lt;em&gt;American Association of Neurological Surgeons&lt;/em&gt;, someone in the United States receives a head injury every 15 seconds. Every five minutes, one of these individuals dies or becomes permanently disabled. Each year 373,000 Americans are hospitalized for severe head injuries. Of these, 99,000 individuals sustain moderate to severe brain injuries resulting in lifelong disabling conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Until recently, what doctors and scientists knew about how the brain works came from observing what stopped working when the brain was injured. Neuroscientists studied thousands of head-trauma victims and methodically mapped specific functions onto various structures of the brain. They found, for instance, that when the frontal lobe of the brain was damaged, patients suffered a loss of motor control. An injury to the temporal lobe of the brain often caused patients to lose the ability to comprehend language and to recognize objects, even though they could still see them. Similarly, researchers found that damage to the limbic system deeper within the brain affected a patient's emotional state. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Obviously, this type of research was painstaking and crude. For starters, head injuries are seldom confined to just one part of the brain but, rather, often involve multiple areas. In addition, different areas of the brain have no visible boundaries between them even when healthy, making the job of correlating structure and function more difficult. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Today, however, neuroscientists can look deep within the human brain without having to wait for a patient with a specific type of head injury to come through the door. They can now observe both properly functioning and improperly functioning brains, including those of children, and make comparisons based on what they see. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One of the latest technologies that allows scientists to do this is called Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). fMRI scanners detect changes in the oxygen level of the blood flowing through the brain. The level of oxygen in the blood in a given area of the brain is directly related to the level of brain activity in that area. For example, the more oxygen being delivered to the cerebral cortex, an area in the upper middle of the brain, the more active that area is. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Researchers might see this pattern of activity if they asked a patient to read or write. In the brain of a person who has a reading problem, however, they might observe a different pattern of activity. Such observations can improve the accuracy of a diagnosis; in a case like this, a doctor would be able to correctly attribute the patient's reading problem to a problem in the brain, as opposed to poor vision or some other reason.</backgrounder>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Shape of Things" describes the pervasiveness of branching systems, which are found in all multicellular organisms.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Shape of Things" describes the critical relationship between form and function in all organisms, in particular, the inherent need for living systems to be served by branching systems.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>All organisms are made up of cells. And nearly every cell, whether it comes from a plant or an animal, a petunia or a whale, is more or less the same size--about 10 to 30 micrometers across, or about one-tenth the diameter of a human hair. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This similarity in size among plant and animal cells is no accident. Active cells really can't be any bigger than they are because they must be able to exchange nutrients and gases across their membranes. If a cell is too large, the ratio of its surface area to its volume will be too low for it to efficiently take in what it needs and get rid of what it doesn't. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Another striking similarity between plants and animals is the manner in which nutrients are distributed to the cells. All organisms rely on a branching system of tubes that puts every cell in contact with every other cell and, more importantly, with the source or sources of the nutrients they need. For example, the 10 trillion cells in the human body are fed regularly by a cardiovascular system that includes some 10 billion capillaries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Scientists refer to these systems as "fractal branching networks," whether they are the vascular systems that serve plants or the circulatory systems that distribute nutrients to animal cells. This means that any given portion of such a system is essentially identical, except in scale, to any other portion of the system. A capillary network in muscle tissue, for example, is simply a miniature version of an artery network in the chest. In essence, every energy transport system is like a tree, with branches of the tree differing in size depending on their location. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Remarkably, in most branches of any one of these systems, the velocity and pressure of the fluid inside the tubes remains constant regardless of its location or the number of times the tubes have branched. This is because the combined cross-sectional area of the tubes at a given branching level is equal to the cross-sectional area of the larger tube from which they feed.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; How does this branching pattern help the plant get energy from the sun? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How is it efficient? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Shape of Things" follows the growth of a duck embryo, from a single fertilized egg cell to a complex, hatching duckling.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "The Shape of Things" charts the development of a duck embryo, from its earliest stages just after fertilization, through cell replication and differentiation, to the final stage, emergence from the protection of the eggshell.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Duck eggs share many traits with other vertebrate eggs. Most importantly, every egg -- whether a microscopic human egg, a frog egg, or a mallard duck egg -- provides the starting point for the development of what will become a complete organism. However, duck eggs, and bird eggs in general, are quite different in form and function from other vertebrate eggs, and these differences dramatically influence the path that development takes for the organism inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One of the most striking differences between bird eggs and other vertebrate eggs is the hard shell that covers bird eggs. The shell provides protection, allowing the growing embryo to develop on land outside the mother's body -- an evolutionary strategy that in some ways proves more efficient for the embryo and the mother. The strategy, of course, requires that the egg be entirely self-contained. All of the nutrients the developing embryo needs must be housed within the confines of the shell. Similarly, all gaseous metabolic waste products must be eliminated through the shell wall, and solid and liquid wastes, which accumulate inside the shell, must be stored in a way that will not harm the embryo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Like the eggs of other organisms, a fertilized duck egg cell, or zygote, begins dividing shortly after fertilization, well before the egg is laid. Unlike most other eggs, however, a large portion of a bird egg is made up of yolk, which serves as a food source for the developing embryo. Because the yolk is simply a food source and not part of the embryo, the entire egg does not cleave or divide in half, as most vertebrate zygotes do. Instead, a flat, layered disk of dividing cells, called a gastrula, forms on the surface of the yolk, pulling nutrients from the yolk as needed. A shell of calcium, applied just before the egg is laid, completes the package; it will provide a protected environment in which the growing embryo can develop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; By the time the fertilized egg is laid it already contains thousands of cells. All of the cells in the gastrula have exactly the same genetic makeup. They differ only in their placement within the three layers of the gastrula -- the ectoderm, the mesoderm, or the endoderm. According to developmental biologists, a cell's placement within the gastrula has a lot to do with what that cell will become. The ectoderm, for example, gives rise to the skin and nervous system; cells of the endoderm become the gut and lungs; and the mesoderm becomes the muscle and bones of the embryo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Throughout its 21-day development the embryo's cells will become increasingly specialized. Some cells will form the lining of the intestine; other cells will become neurons in the brain. Every cell, however, will remain part of an integrated whole, a complex combination of many different types of cells working in harmony with one another.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Why do you think cells specialize to form the nervous system and cardiovascular system before forming other organs such as the kidney? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Compare a duck embryo with an adult duck: How do the cells of each get raw materials? How do the cells of each get oxygen? How do the cells of each get rid of carbon dioxide? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What is meant by "raw materials for growth"? Yolk has all the raw materials a duck embryo needs before it hatches. Where does a duckling get the raw materials it needs for growth? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What is being distributed in the system of distribution? &lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>See how the human heart moves blood through the body in this animated feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cut to the Heart" Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This animated feature, part of the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Cut to the Heart" Web site, illustrates how the chambers of the heart contract and relax in synchrony to push blood through the pulmonary and systemic loops of the circulatory system. Watch oxygen-depleted blood being pumped to the lungs, where it acquires oxygen before traveling back to the heart and ultimately being distributed throughout the body.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The heart's primary function is to pump blood to all parts of the body, bringing nutrients and oxygen to tissues and removing waste products from them. Even when our body is at rest, our tissues require a certain rate of blood circulation. During exercise or times when greater demands are placed on the body, blood circulation must increase. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To meet these variable demands, heart rate increases or decreases. In addition, blood vessels dilate to deliver more blood, or constrict during times when less blood is required. Usually, our heart works infallibly, beating about 100,000 times a day, or some 2.5 billion times in an average lifetime. Unfortunately, like other muscles and systems in the body, the heart and circulatory system can't always keep up with the demand. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Heart disease is the number-one cause of death in the United States, resulting in more than 700,000 deaths annually. Coronary artery disease (CAD), a narrowing of the arteries supplying blood to the heart, is the most common form of heart disease. Although CAD often begins when a person is very young, the disease's symptoms are usually not felt until late in a person's life. Increasingly constricted arteries significantly weaken the pumping action of the heart and, in the most extreme cases, can cause congestive heart failure -- a potentially lethal buildup of fluid in the lungs and other body tissues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Among people more than 70 years old, about 8 out of 1,000 are diagnosed with congestive heart failure each year. This means not that their heart has stopped working, but that their heart is not pumping effectively enough to meet their body's need for oxygen-rich blood, either during exercise or at rest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Fortunately, treatments do exist for patients who have suffered congestive heart failure, including medications that lower blood pressure, lower heart rate, and improve the efficiency of the heart's contractions. The best treatment for congestive heart failure, however, is the prevention of heart disease in the first place. A healthful diet, regular exercise, weight control, and abstinence from smoking can all help prevent coronary artery disease and other forms of heart disease.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; Why does the heart separate the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why does the heart have valves? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why do we need blood circulated through the body? What does it do?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Methuselah Tree" Web site details the process of photosynthesis and its role in the oxygen/carbon dioxide cycle.</annotation>
      <synopsis>&lt;p&gt;This interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Methuselah Tree" Web site explores the process plants use to convert solar energy into chemical energy. The site points out that photosynthesis is responsible for feeding nearly all life forms on Earth, and that the process generates, as a by-product, an element that is critically important to the survival of humans and most other animals: oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>&lt;p&gt;Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and a few types of single-celled organisms use energy from the sun to transform carbon dioxide and water into a storable form of energy: glucose. One of the most important and impressive aspects of this relatively simple process is that it is responsible for feeding -- either directly or indirectly -- nearly all life forms on Earth. Plants, of course, use some of their own stored energy to support their life processes. First and foremost, the energy from photosynthesis is used by plants for growth and reproduction. Animals, however, evolved long ago to take advantage of the energy that plants store in their tissues. The majority of animals, including humans, rely on the carbohydrates found in plant roots, stems, leaves, and fruits as their primary source of energy. Even animals that eat only meat benefit from plants indirectly. Animals also store energy in their tissues. Thus, the energy a plant-eater acquires when it consumes a plant can be transferred to an animal when it consumes the plant-eater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The starting point for this transfer of energy is photosynthesis, and the most critical factor in photosynthesis is light. Plants can't produce glucose and other carbohydrates without light, nor can most plants live for more than a few days without at least some light. Of course most plants do survive and flourish even though they undergo several hours of darkness every 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get through the night, most plants reverse the photosynthetic process for a time and, like air-breathing animals, respire, or burn carbohydrates and oxygen while producing carbon dioxide and water. Even during the day most plants photosynthesize and respire simultaneously, although at these times the rate of photosynthesis is much higher than the rate of respiration. The carbon dioxide produced during respiration is immediately used in photosynthesis and excess oxygen is released into the environment.&lt;/p&gt;</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc;"&gt;&lt;li&gt; Does the plant give off oxygen at night or when the shade is down? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Does the plant use oxygen at night or when the shade is down? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The person takes in oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Do plants do this as well? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How does the process of photosynthesis help the plant? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What organisms can carry out photosynthesis?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Help the immune system fight off an infection in this interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Surviving AIDS" Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>How does the immune system respond when an infection attacks the body? In this interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Surviving AIDS" Web site, you're put in charge of destroying a virus -- in this case, the mumps virus -- running wild inside a cell. You'll quickly see that it is an uphill battle as the virus starts making copies of itself. Throughout the activity, descriptions of what is happening appear onscreen, as does an explanation of what makes an attack by the human immunodeficiency virus unique -- and devastating.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The immune system is a collection of molecules, cells, and organs whose complex interactions form a defense network capable of protecting the body from outside invaders. Immune cells, called lymphocytes, are critical to the proper functioning of the immune system. When they encounter foreign cells, some lymphocytes respond by producing antibodies -- large proteins that destroy or otherwise interfere with the vital activities of foreign cells. Other types of lymphocytes, called T cells, either actively kill the foreign cells using powerful chemicals, or secrete chemicals that attract macrophages that eat foreign cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A healthy immune system can successfully fight invaders such as the virus that causes mumps. Viruses like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS, however, are not so easily dealt with. This is because the virus attacks the T cells themselves, disrupting the body's natural immune response. To combat the virus's onslaught, the immune system produces a billion new T cells every day. Unfortunately, the viruses also replicate about a billion times each day. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In a person infected with HIV, the body's immune system fights the virus -- day after day, month after month, sometimes year after year. Eventually, though, the immune system exhausts itself. The number of T cells drops dramatically, and without this vital component of the immune system, the body is left susceptible to other diseases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As has happened with some other diseases caused by microbes, many medical researchers believe that AIDS may one day be cured by a vaccine. Vaccines work by introducing the body to otherwise harmful microorganisms in a safe, controlled manner. Often the microbes in a vaccine are dead or otherwise rendered harmless. Even dead viruses, however, are often enough to elicit the body's immune response -- its ability to recognize and fight off a particular virus should it ever come into contact with the virus again. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In many ways the creation of a vaccine seems like an obvious approach for curing AIDS. It worked surprisingly well in the past. Polio used to kill or maim more than a million people worldwide every year. Today, this disease is but a distant memory. Unfortunately, the vaccine approach worked as well as it did with diseases like because the human immune system already had some innate ability to fight the viruses that caused them. Generation after generation of human populations had evolved with these viruses and, thus, had become better at fighting them and the diseases they cause. Indeed, humans have at least some natural ability to fight most viruses. That, unfortunately, is not the case with HIV, perhaps because human beings have not been exposed to the virus for long enough. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Recent findings suggest that HIV has been in the human population for only a short time. The virus, according to at least one study, probably jumped from chimpanzees to humans very recently -- maybe only a few decades ago. If this is the case, researchers surmise that our species would not have had time to evolve resistance to the virus's effects, as it seems chimpanzees and a few other species with viruses similar to HIV have. Despite the setback in what some thought would be a simple solution to a global epidemic, many researchers remain committed to the idea of an AIDS vaccine. Toward this end, some are studying a small group of people -- perhaps 5 percent of the HIV-positive population -- who have the virus but don't show any symptoms and whose infection remains at very low levels. Many experts believe these people's immune systems have learned to fight the virus differently than other people's -- in a way that the body could "learn" through a vaccine.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; If the human body can successfully fight off the mumps virus, why is it hard to fight AIDS? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What is meant by the term "trigger?" &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What cells that fight disease are always present in the body? What cells or parts of cells are produced after the disease-causing virus enters the body? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What are some different ways the body develops immunity to a disease? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Does a person have to have mumps to be immune to the mumps virus?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>This animation from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Battle in the War on Cancer: Breast Cancer" describes how oncogenes cause cancer and how cancerous cells can spread throughout the body.</annotation>
      <synopsis>This video segment from &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Battle in the War on Cancer: Breast Cancer" describes the role of oncogenes in uncontrolled cancerous growth and depicts the journey of cancer cells from where they originate, into the circulatory system, and then on to other parts of the body.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>Cancer is defined as any of a group of diseases in which particular cells in a body cease to respond to normal growth controls. The cells multiply unchecked, crowding out, invading, and destroying other tissues. One of the most important discoveries in cancer research in recent years are the genes that scientists think promote this unrestricted growth, called oncogenes. Experts believe that oncogenes alter receptor molecules located on the surface of cells that are responsible for signaling the cell to divide. These receptors somehow get stuck in the "on" position, sending signals to the cells to replicate at a rate that far exceeds cell loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Oncogenes and faulty receptors are certainly critical to the formation of cancerous tumors. Studies show, however, that the blood vessels that feed a growing tumor are just as important. Without a steady supply of oxygen and nutrients, cancerous tissues grow extremely slowly, are unable to spread throughout the body, or die out altogether.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The circulatory system must extend to all living tissues within the body. Therefore, wherever the body is undergoing development, growth, or repair, it must also grow a network of new blood vessels in a process called angiogenesis. Cancerous tissues are no different, although they promote angiogenesis somewhat indirectly. Tumor cells send chemical signals, called activator molecules, to the host's healthy cells. These chemical signals activate genes in the healthy tissue that, in turn, encourage the growth of new blood vessels into and around the cancerous tissue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Medical researchers are now using this knowledge in their search for a cure for cancer. In one study, injections of a protein called endostatin, known to inhibit angiogenesis, greatly reduced the number of cancer cells and the size of tumors in a group of laboratory mice. Whether or not similar drugs can safely prevent the growth and spread of cancer cells in humans has been the focus of dozens of ongoing clinical trials since the late 1990s. While cancer researchers are cautious with their predictions, they say that results of these trials may lead to successful treatments of some forms of cancer.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; What other kinds of signals do you think cells would respond to that would make them grow and divide appropriately? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why do you think the oncogene acts as though it is stuck in the "on" position?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>

      <annotation>Perform a virtual heart transplant in 19 easy steps with this interactive feature from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Electric Heart" Web site.</annotation>
      <synopsis>In this hands-on exercise from the &lt;em&gt;NOVA:&lt;/em&gt; "Electric Heart" Web site, you'll enter a virtual operating theater and perform a heart transplant. While this version of the operation has been greatly simplified, all of the basic steps are included. By the end of the operation, you will have a good idea of what's involved in taking the heart from one person and making it function in another.</synopsis>
      <backgrounder>The first human heart transplant was performed in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1967. The 54-year-old patient survived for just 18 days following the surgery. In the five years that followed that first operation, several a hundred transplants were performed, but each with very little success: Only 15 percent of patients survived even a year after the procedure, and few of those survived longer than that. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The greatest hurdle to successful heart transplantation in those early days was the patient's own immune response, which caused the body to reject the foreign organ. Today, doctors have greatly improved the rate of transplant success, using drugs that suppress the patient's immune response. Despite advances in transplantation medicine, however, the availability of human hearts suitable for transplanting remains quite low. This constant shortage has prompted medical researchers to look for options other than donated organs, including cross-species transplants, artificial hearts, and tissue engineering and cloning technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The procedure of transplanting animal organs into humans, or xenotransplantation, became a reality in 1964 (before the first human-to-human heart transplant) with the first chimpanzee-to-human heart transplant. While this pioneering procedure was ultimately unsuccessful (the chimpanzee heart was not large enough to sustain the circulatory needs of the human patient) it promised a steady supply of organs -- if the right species could be found. Today, most xenotransplantation research focuses on pigs, since the size and output of an average-sized pig heart is very close to that of a human heart. Unfortunately, rejection is even more likely in cross-species transplants. And drugs that can keep a patient from rejecting a pig heart render that patient's body almost completely defenseless in the event of infection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Artificial hearts have proven to be a good way for patients and doctors to buy time while waiting for suitable donor organs. There are more than two dozen different types of artificial hearts available, but none of these devices provides a permanent solution. One pump currently being tested on animals, however, has some potential to replace live organ transplants, according to researchers. This thumb-sized, battery-powered device is implanted directly inside the left ventricle, where it pumps up to 16 pints of blood per minute. Human trials with this device should begin by 2007. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Another technology that may someday prove to be a transplant surgeon's dream: an endless supply of organs and tissue matched to their recipient. It sounds like science fiction but, in theory at least, may one day be possible. The technique involves stem cells, those cells in embryos (and, to a lesser extent, adults) that have the potential to become any one of the 200 types of cells that make up the human body, including heart cells. Researchers are working now, with some success, on directing stem cells to develop into cardiac tissue. As yet, no one has successfully grown a human heart, but that day may not be as far off as it once seemed.</backgrounder>
      <questions>&lt;li&gt; What are some of the reasons people might need heart transplants? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Where do you think donor hearts come from? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; In recent years, doctors have investigated the possibility of making transplants from different species into humans because donor hearts are scarce. Why do you think this might be problematic?&lt;/li&gt;</questions>
