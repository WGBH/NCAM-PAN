      <title>Logistics Manager</title>
      <description>This Career Clip features Philip Stockdale, Logistics Manager at DSC Logistics.  The facility that Philip works in is a  1.2 million square foot facility with 150 employees and what he enjoys the most is that everyday is different.  Philip started out at DSC as a forklift driver and moved up to supervisor and from there into the management roles.  The best career advice is to continue to learn and never limit yourself by the types of positions you are willing to take.</description>
