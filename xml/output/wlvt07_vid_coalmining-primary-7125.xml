      <title>Coal Mining</title>
      <description>Anthracite coal once powered America, providing heat and transportation.  At its height, the coal mining industry employed more than 200,000 people.  Today, the coal mining industry in Pennsylvania has all but disappeared.  All that remains are abandoned mines carved into the earth.  The  last mine in Eastern Pennsylvania closed in 1972, and despite efforts to preserve these mines, most have fallen into disrepair.  Coal mining is a part of history now, but it is not forgotten thanks ot the photography of George Harvan.  Harvan documented the human side of coal mining, preserving the  images and the emotions of the men who risked their lives for coal.</description>
