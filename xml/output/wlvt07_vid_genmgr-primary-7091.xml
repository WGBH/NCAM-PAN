      <title>General Manager</title>
      <description>This Career Clip features Steve Morrow, General Manager of the Lehigh Valley Syrup Plant for Coca-Cola.  He is in charge of the entire facility and spends some time explaining that they train each of their technicians and that "yes, it is possible to get paid to drink soda all day long."   The best advice he ever received was to do what you like to do.  Find a job that  includes something you enjoy because you will be doing it a long time, and if you enjoy it you will be better at whatever it is.</description>
