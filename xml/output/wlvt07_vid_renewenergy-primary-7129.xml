      <title>Renewable Energy</title>
      <description>The sun can power your washing machine.  The wind can give the energy for a light bulb.  Vegetable oil can be used as fuel for a car.  These energy saving technologies are not only possible; they exist already.  Sam and AnneMarie Yoder have already put many of these newer toeghnologies to use on their farm in Berks County, PA.  In most cases these technologies not only help preserve the environment, but they also cost less than traditional methods of creating and consuming energy.  This program was produced for Lehigh Valley Tempo!, a weekly news magazine program of WLVT PBS 39.</description>
